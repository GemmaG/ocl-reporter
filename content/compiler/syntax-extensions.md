Since its creation camlp4 has proven to be a very useful tool. People
have used it to experiment with new features for OCaml and to provide
interesting meta-programming facilities. However, there is general
agreement that camlp4 is too powerful and complex for the applications
that it is most commonly used for, and there is a growing movement to
provide a simpler alternative.

A working group was formed (wg-camlp4@lists.ocaml.org) and the
implementation of a simpler alternative using `-ppx` was discussed.
