As the projects around the [ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org) are becoming more
established, it is important to document how the domain-name itself is being
managed.  Therefore we have begun to put together a governance framework that
clarifies how the domain is currently managed and will allow it to grow and
develop as the community does. 

A brief summary of the growth of the projects and the factors that are part of
the governance document can be found online at:
