`Vg` is a declarative library for describing vector scenes in OCaml.  It's a
baseline library that is intended to be compiled to diverse backends such as
HTML5 Canvas or WebGL to render graphics.  This project aims to build a "Tufte
principled" 2D visualization library with some simple graphing widgets for data
visualisation.  In the longer term, the intention is to build a declarative UI
framework also.
