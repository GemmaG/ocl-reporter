Two new people joined the core team at Cambridge: [Jeremy Yallop](../people/jyallop.html) and [Philippe Wang](../people/pwang.html)!
Jeremy has extensive expertise with meta-programming and generic programming,
and is initially looking at the [camlp4 redesign](../tasks/compiler.html#Camlp4%20redesign).
Philippe has been taking on the challenge of running OCaml well on restricted embedded systems, which
will also have knockon benefits to x86 compilation with the same optimisations.
[Xavier Clerc](http://www.x9c.fr) also joined us for a day in advance of his
visit in April, with much interest in his [Argot](http://argot.x9c.fr) project
and the upcoming [redesign of OCaml.org](../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign).

Two new research grants have been awarded that are relevant to the OCaml Labs mission:

* [Network-as-a-Service](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K032968/1) is a 3-year grant to solve pressing problems in "Big Data" processing, and will enable us to continue to develop [MirageOS](http://openmirage.org) and the use of OCaml and functional programming in this space.  We're going to be collaborating with Imperial and Nottingham on this, with the Cambridge efforts led by [Andrew Moore](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~awm22/), [Jon Crowcroft](../people/crowcroft.html) and [Anil Madhavapeddy](../people/avsm.html).
* [Rigorous Engineering of Mainstream Systems](http://rems.io) asks how we can use rigorous maths to improve the quality of mainstream computer systems.  It is led by [Peter Sewell](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20) at Cambridge, and most of the tools (including [Ott](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/) and [Lem](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sao/lem/)) are written in OCaml and will benefit from the ongoing work at OCaml Labs.

### Platform projects

<b>OPAM: </b> [OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com), the popular OCaml Package Manager, recently had its [1.0
release](http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/03/14/opam-1.0.0.html)!  OPAM has
been in development for just over a year, and this is a significant milestone
for the project.  The OPAM [package repository](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues) has had over
500 issues, closed over 400 pull requests and now contains over 450 packages
(and more than twice that number if you consider that multiple versions are
available).  This kind of user adoption is a fantastic sign for the OCaml
community.  We're very happy to be using OPAM as a key piece of the upcoming
OCaml Platform and the continuous integration and test system.

<b>Redesign: </b> As part of the [redesign
work](../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign), and to showcase the kind of
additional functionality we'd like to create, Amir put together a set of
screencasts that talk though a wireframe demo of the new site.  These short
videos covered elements of design, the new documentation system and an overview
of how the continuous integration system would work.  You can read more and
experience the clickable demo via [Amir's blog post](http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg).

<b>Mailing lists</b>: A new <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opengl">opengl@lists.ocaml.org</a> was
set up for those interested in OpenGL and WebGL on OCaml, and discussion so far
has covered LabGL on the Raspberry Pi. There are also still plans to begin
working groups for build systems and parallelism but will be announced in due
course once the preparatory work has been completed.

<b>Real World OCaml</b>: The book is now on [alpha3](http://www.realworldocaml.org),
where Part 1 is nearly complete.  New sections on installation and a more
expanded prologue have also been included in this version.

### Systems research

<a href="../images/heidi-signposts.jpg"><img class="right" width="130px" src="../images/heidi-signposts-thumb.jpg"></img></a>
<b>Mirage</b>: Anil gave two tech talks about [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) this month at Citrix and Microsoft Research, as practise talks for [ASPLOS 2013](http://asplos13.rice.edu). Mirage itself is nearing a release, and [Vincent Bernardoff](https://github.com/vbmithr) has joined the Citrix engineering team to help drive it to release. He's been primarily focussed on the build frontend (dubbed [Mirari](../tasks/mirage.html#Mirari)) to make Mirage applications easier to compile out-of-the-box.

<b>Signposts</b>: [Heidi](../people/hhoward.html) gave an excellent talk about Signpost and the benefits it can offer internet users today (see image on the left). This was one of a set of talks that took place in the Computer Lab, organised by [Alan Mycroft](../people/amycroft.html), on open software and open hardware with speakers such as [Jon 'maddog' Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer)) of Linux International.  

### Compiler projects

<b>camlp4 redesign:</b> There has been more discussion about the future of camlp4 and [Leo posted another summary](http://www.lpw25.net/2013/02/05/camlp4-alternative-part-2.html) on his thoughts for an alternative apporach to quotations.

<b>Namespaces:</b> Leo's also been extremely busy in the [platform mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform), which has been the location for the discussion of namespaces.  A few hundred emails have been exchanged on this topic and Leo has summarised the discussion and made proposals in his blog post about [OCaml namespaces](http://www.lpw25.net/2013/03/10/ocaml-namespaces.html).  ALthough this is a complex issue, aspects of namespaces will be important to the work on the OCaml Platform so we look forward to the outcome of these discussions.
