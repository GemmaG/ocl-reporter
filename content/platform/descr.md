The OCaml Platform combines the core OCaml compiler with a coherent set of
libraries, tools and documentation.  The requirements and direction of the
Platform are initially being guided by large users of OCaml such as [Jane
Street](http://ocaml.janestreet.com),
[Citrix](http://www.xen.org/files/XenCloud/ocamldoc/) and
[Lexifi](http://www.lexifi.com/product/technology/ocaml).

The reason for initially taking direction from industrial users is because
these companies have a great deal of experience of using the language at scale
(e.g millions of lines of code, thousands of modules and complicated testing
requirements). We take a pragmatic view that examining and solving the problems
such users have will ultimately result in a large and positive impact on the
wider community, through significantly improved tooling, libraries and
documentation.
