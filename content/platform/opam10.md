OPAM 1.0 is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and a
Git-friendly development workflow.  This first version is build-system agnostic
in the interests of compatibility with the large existing body of third party
external source code.
