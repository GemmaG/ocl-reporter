The projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more established,
and so we need to think about how they are organised and governed.  

As part of this, we have been looking over how larger projects manage
themselves, as well as to put such a document together for the OCaml community
as regards projects running the <ocaml.org> domain without introducing
burdensome processes.

The ongoing work into governance is firstly identifying all the existing
stakeholders for the various sites (such as the mailing lists, source control,
Forge, web pages and machine infrastructure) and documenting the reality.
