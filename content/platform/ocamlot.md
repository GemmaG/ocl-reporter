OCamlot (OCaml Online Testing), is a Continuous Integration and Testing system for packages provided via [OPAM][].  It comprises all the appropriate tools and libraries to enable management and development of the machine infrastructure, for example an OCaml library to interface with Github (available through OPAM).  The resourcing and commissioning of the [Machine infrastructure] is dealt with separately to the software that will enable it.

This The Continuous integration project is geared towards creating a pool of physical machines used to continuously test packages that are packaged via OPAM.

This includes creating the appropriate tools and libraries to enable management and development of machine infrastructure, for example an OCaml library to interface with Github (available through OPAM).

Current status: Creating a spec to define the overall components required.
