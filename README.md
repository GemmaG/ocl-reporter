`ocl-reporter` converts a directory of files containing project and people
information into a set of web pages for OCaml Labs.

It's currently not intended for external use (mainly because it was hacked
together at high speed for purpose), but we do intend to evolve it into a
more general purpose reporting tool for other projects too.

Run `make run www` to generate the pages and browse them in `pages/`.
