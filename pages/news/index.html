       <h2 id="Feb 2013">Feb 2013</h2>
       <div style="width:75%"><p>The second monthly meeting was held last Friday and we are now settling down in to a regular set of agenda items with additional items as necessary. We're still thinking of how to best incorporate remote attendance so please do bear with us.</p>
<p>Two new people joined the team, <a href="../people/jyallop.html">Jeremy Yallop</a> and <a href="../people/pwang.html">Philippe Wang</a>. Jeremy has been doing some great work related to the OCamlot continuous integration system, while Philippe has been taking on the challenge of running OCaml well on the Raspberry Pi, with it's restricted memory. We'll have more to say about their progress in next month's update. Xavier Clerc also joined us for a day in advance of his visit in April and he, Leo and Amir discussed his work on Argot and the upcoming redesign of OCaml.org.</p>
<p>TODO: New research grant funding was also awarded for the set of projects related to 'Networking as a Service'. This 3 year grant covers ....</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform projects</h3>
<p>OPAM, the popular OCaml Package Manager, recently had its 1.0 release! OPAM has been in development for just over a year and this is a significant milestone for the project and the team behind it. The OPAM package repository has had over 500 issues dealt with, closed over 400 pull requests and now contains over 370 packages (and more than twice that number if you consider that multiple versions are available). This kind of user-adoption is a fantastic sign for the wider OCaml community. We're very happy to be using OPAM as a key piece of the upcoming OCaml Platform and the continuous integration and test system.</p>
<p>As part of the redesign work, and to showcase the kind of additional functionality we'd like to create, Amir put together a set of screencasts that talk though a wireframe demo of the new site. These short videos covered elements of design, the new documentation system and an overview of how the continuous integration system would work. You can read more and experience the clickable demo via <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg">Amir's blog post</a></p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>A new list was set up for those who are interested in OpenGL and WebGL on OCaml and discussion so far has covered LabGL on the Raspberry Pi. If this is an area that interests you, them please do join the discussion on the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">mailing list</a>. There are also still plans to begin working groups for build systems and parallelism but will be announced in due course.</p>
<p>The Real World OCaml book is now on <a href="http://www.realworldocaml.org">alpha3</a>, where Part 1 is nearly complete. New sections on installation and a more expanded prologue have also been included in this version.</p>
<h3 id="systems-research">Systems research</h3>
<p>Anil gave two talks about Mirage this month at Citrix Systems and Microsoft Research. The talks were well received and people were excited about the approach taken and the possibilities that Mirage enables. Mirage itself is nearing a release and members of the team are heading out to present the work at ASPLOS.</p>
<p>TODO Mirari is taking shape and Vincent has done a bunch of work related to 'run' (but ami doesn't know what)</p>
<p><a href="../people/hhoward.html">Heidi</a> gave an excellent talk about Signpost and the benefits it can offer internet users today. This was one of a set of talks that took place in the Computer Lab, organised by <a href="../people/amycroft.html">Alan Mycroft</a>, on open software and open hardware with speakers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer)">Jon 'maddog' Hall</a> of Linux International.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-projects">Compiler projects</h3>
<p>Since last month, there has been more discussion about camlp4 and <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/2013/02/05/camlp4-alternative-part-2.html">Leo posted another summary</a> on his thoughts for quotations. In the next few weeks, Leo will also summarise the discussion to date.</p>
<p>Leo's also been extremely busy in the platform mailing list, which has been the location for the discussion of namespaces. A few hundred emails have been exchanged on this topic and Leo has summarised the discussion and made proposals in his blog post about <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/2013/03/10/ocaml-namespaces.html">OCaml namespaces</a>. ALthough this is a complex issue, aspects of namespaces will be important to the work on the OCaml Platform so we look forward to the outcome of these discussions.</p>
</div>
     
       <h2 id="Jan 2013">Jan 2013</h2>
       <div style="width:75%"><p>January's update is broken down into the three overall themes of OCaml Labs, specifically, Platform, Systems and Compiler projects with some additional points at the end. In general, there seems to be more interest than expected in the work we're doing and the number of collaborative projects is increasing. We need to do more work on the reporting structure but it would be useful to have some feedback on what you would find most useful. Please do get in touch if you have comments.</p>
<p>We held the first of the monthly meetings last Friday, in the Computer Lab.<br />Anil provided an overview of the research work that OCaml Labs is involved with and the updates are also described below. An interesting theme of the discussion that followed was related to undergraduate teaching and how things like the OCaml Platform and infrastructure would make it easier for students to get to grips with programming.</p>
<p>For the evening after the meeting, <a href="../people/achaudhry.html">Amir</a> set up an informal OCaml hacking/tutorial session in Cambridge. Around 15 eager people attended the event in <a href="http://makespace.org">Makespace</a> (a community workshop), with most of them being new to the language. Anil introduced <a href="../projects/rwo.html#output-book-website">Real World OCaml</a> and shared the introductory chapters while Thomas provided help with OPAM. This turned out to be a great test of the installation process for newcomers to OCaml, as well as the book's instructions. A number of issues came to light, partly related to a perfect storm of package issues, which everyone is keen to improve. Despite these problems, attendees were very positive and were keen to see more gatherings like this in future. When Amir asked for feedback, pretty much everyone commented on how great the pizza was.</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform projects</h3>
<p>OCaml Labs also hosted its first visitor this month.<br /><a href="../people/tgazagnaire.html">Thomas Gazagnaire</a>, lead developer of the popular OPAM package manager and CTO of OCamlPro, spent three weeks in Cambridge. Much effort was put into preparing Mirage for release, discussions about parallelism and the OCaml Platform. In fact, anything where OPAM is a crucial component. This was a great productivity boost and we look forward to future visits, both from Thomas and others. An item worth noting is that (at time of writing) the <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository">opam-repository</a> has now become the <a href="https://github.com/languages/OCaml">overall most forked OCaml project on Github</a>.<br />The <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/platform/">Platform mailing list</a> has also been formed for discussion regarding the OCaml Platform. Anyone interested in the discussions about the platform, which will include development on OPAM, should join this list.</p>
<p>Part of the Platform work involves creating a new <a href="../projects/infrastructure.html#output-web-design-content">design for OCaml.org</a>, which also <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-February/000194.html">kicked-off this week</a>.<br />Amir will keep people updated about progress via updates to the <a href="../projects/infrastructure.html#output-web-design-content">OCL website</a>, <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/">Infrastructure mailing list</a> and also by posting things to the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki">OCaml.org Github wiki</a>. The current stage of work involves thinking of the types of pages OCaml.org requires, in order to refine the templates we need. As part of this, we also commissioned a new logo for OCaml and although it's still under development, you can see the latest draft on the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos">OCaml.org wiki</a>. Please send any feedback directly to Amir.</p>
<p>The Real World OCaml book website was released as a <a href="http://www.realworldocaml.org">limited alpha</a> earlier in the month, with the aim of getting early feedback and comments. Each paragraph of the online book has commenting functionality, using Github issues as a backend. This means that each comment made on the book website creates a new issue on Github, which authors/commenters can track and discuss before editing the content. So far there have been over 250 comments on the alpha, with half them being dealt with already.</p>
<p>A new EU project also kicked-off, called Trilogy 2, which builds on the previous, award-winning work from the original Trilogy project. This is especially relevant for OCaml Labs as OnApp (a member of Trilogy 2), will be providing <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-February/000198.html">Cloud Infrastructure for ocaml.org</a>. We look forward to seeing this develop.</p>
<h3 id="systems-research">Systems research</h3>
<p>Mirage was formally proposed as an <a href="../projects/mirage.html#output-xen-incubate-meeting">incubated Xen.org project</a> and the proposal was put forward for <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Mirage_Incubation_Project_Proposal">community review</a>. There were many positive comments on the Xen mailing lists (along the lines of <a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg01084.html">"Mirage is cool stuff"</a>) and voting is currently underway by eligible members of the Xen community. Assuming a positive outcome, incubation would give the Mirage project greater visibility and access to resources. This would accelerate progress towards an alpha release in Q1/Q2 this year. In addition to this, a proposal for an <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">OSCON talk</a> was also submitted and the camera-ready version of the ASPLOS paper is <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">now available</a>.</p>
<p>A related research topic where Mirage could be useful is in embedded systems and the Internet of Things. One specific use case is the <a href="../projects/illuminate.html">Illuminate Project</a>, where Mirage can be used to create appliances running on the ARM microcontrollers alongside an LED lighting network. Such a lighting system is now deployed in large parts of the Computer Laboratory and will form an excellent test-bed to explore these ideas further.</p>
<p>Signpost is also achieving greater outreach with <a href="../people/jcrowcroft.html">Jon Crowcroft</a> discussing such technologies at a meeting in Dagstul on <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13062">Decentralized Systems for Privacy Preservation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-projects">Compiler projects</h3>
<p>Several mailing lists are in progress for various community-driven projects. The first of these is a working group on the future of syntax extensions in OCaml, beyond camlp4 ( <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4">wg-camlp4</a>). This group is chaired by <a href="http://alain.frisch.fr">Alain Frisch</a> and Leo White and has generated a great deal of discussion in the last two weeks. Leo is summarising his thoughts in a series of <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">blog posts</a> as he goes.</p>
<p>Further working groups on parallelism in OCaml and build systems are under discussion and will be announced in due course.</p>
<h3 id="one-more-thing-...-actually-three">One more thing ... (actually three)</h3>
<p>As well as all the research and development activity we've also been recruiting. We've had several rounds of interviews and made a number of offers so hopefully we'll be announcing new members of the OCaml Labs team in the coming months. In addition, we'd also like to mention that Leo successfully defended his PhD Thesis in January. Finally, we'd like to welcome a new honorary member of OCaml Labs, Nathan Scott, born on 30th January. Congratulations Dave!</p>

       <h2 id="Dec 2012">Dec 2012</h2>
       <div style="width:75%"><p>OCaml Labs kicked-off with an internal meeting of the Cambridge-based members. There are over 20 people involved just within the building and over 30 including those outside the University. We welcomed a few new members, including Leo White (Postdoc), Raphael Proust (PhD student) and Stephen Dolan (PhD student). At this initial gathering Anil talked over some of the projects that were already taking place in the Lab, as well as the new work that would be supported by OCaml Labs.</p>
<p>Significant progress was made on the research side too. <a href="../projects/mirage.html">Mirage</a> has had a flurry of new releases as we prepare for a first public release, and we're in the final stages of being officially incubated as a <a href="../projects/mirage.html#output-xen-incubate-meeting">xen.org project</a>. <a href="../projects/signpost.html">Signpost</a> is also taking shape, mainly due to the addition of DNSSEC to the <a href="../projects/signpost#output-code-mirage-ocaml-dns">ocaml-dns</a> implementation. There's been industrial interest in the applications of Signpost and the team is pursuing these for more use cases.</p>
<p>We also began work on a new website for the <a href="../projects/rwo.html">Real World OCaml</a>. We took inspiration from our friends who wrote Real World Haskell, and the site will have commenting functionality so that people can suggest improvements before the book is finalised. As part of this, we also worked with a design firm to begin creating a <a href="../projects/infrastructure.html">new logo for the OCaml language</a>. The logo will be placed into the public domain for use by anyone.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, Ashish put the new <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> website live, to much electronic <a href="https://twitter.com/jakedonham/status/281170330700095488">applause</a>. A great way to end 2012!</p>
</div>
     
       <h2 id="Nov 2012">Nov 2012</h2>
       <div style="width:75%"><p>OCaml Labs finally opened its doors with announcements from <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/109">Yaron</a> and <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2012/10/19/announcing-ocaml-labs.html">Anil</a>! Although much of the remainder of November was spent on administration and wiring up machines for the forthcoming <a href="../projects/opambuilder.html">test cluster</a>, we also celebrated the acceptance of a paper on <a href="../projects/mirage.html">Mirage</a> to <a href="../projects/mirage.html#output-asplos2013">ASPLOS 2013</a>.</p>
<p>We also had a very productive visit from OCamlPro. Fabrice, Thomas and Pierre came over to discuss the new OPAM package manager and the plans for building an OCaml Platform in 2013. This was in preparation for the subsequent Consortium meeting of the industrial board of OCaml, where Anil was able to present (and get approved) an overview of what <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> would become. You can see the <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/slides/OCaml-Consortium-2012-OCamlLabs.pdf">slides of his talk online</a>. An interesting thing to note is just how broad the set of OCaml language users are: right the way from formal methods, to systems projects, and even web developers.</p>
<p>Since the Consortium meeting, the infrastructure behind ocaml.org is being built out and there's already been helpful input via the <a href="../projects/infrastructure.html#output-web-design-content">infrastructure mailing list</a>. A continuous build system has been put together for internal testing, with support from Citrix, and <a href="#opam">OPAM</a> itself continues to mature and grow in popularity.</p>
