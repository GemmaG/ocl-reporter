<p>Today, we will look at another way to resolve a DNS query, being a DNS server.

<p>The above code will serve DNS requests to port 53, responding with the resource records (RR) in test.zone. We have provided an example zone file in the <a href="https://github.com/heidi-ann/ocaml-dns-examples">repo</a>&#160;with the code from this guide. To use this unikernel, we also need to edit the config.ml file from yesterday.</p>
<pre>open Mirage

let data = crunch "./data"

let handler =
  foreign "Unikernel.Main" (console @-&gt; kv_ro @-&gt; stackv4 @-&gt; job)

let ip_config:ipv4_config = {
  address= Ipaddr.V4.make 192 168 1 2;
  netmask= Ipaddr.V4.make 255 255 255 0;
  gateways= [Ipaddr.V4.make 192 168 1 1];
}

let direct =
  let stack = direct_stackv4_with_static_ipv4 default_console tap0 ip_config  in

let () =
  add_to_ocamlfind_libraries ["dns.mirage";"dns.lwt-core"];
  add_to_opam_packages ["dns"];
  register "dns" [direct]
</pre>
<p>We are using crunch to access the zone file in the data directory. As explain in part 1, this config file is specific to my network setup for xen backends and can easily be generalised.</p>
<p>You can now test your DNS server and see it work</p>

</ul>
<p>For debugging I am a big fan for wireshark. I run a full wireshark sesson on the machine which is connection sharing to my cubieboard network, to check all external traffic.</p>
<p>For this guide, I will always be compiling for Xen ARM backend, with direct network connection via br0 and a static IP for all unikernels. My test network router is configured to give out static IP of the form 192.168.1.x to hosts&#160;with the MAC address 00:00:00:00:00:0x. As a result, my config.ml file look like:</p>
<pre>open Mirage

let ip_config:ipv4_config = {
  address= Ipaddr.V4.make 192 168 1 2;
  netmask= Ipaddr.V4.make 255 255 255 0;
  gateways= [Ipaddr.V4.make 192 168 1 1];
}

let client =
  foreign "Unikernel.Client" @@ console @-&gt; stackv4 @-&gt; job

let () =
  add_to_ocamlfind_libraries [ "dns.mirage"; ];
  register "dns-client" 
[ client $ default_console $ direct_stackv4_with_static_ipv4 default_console tap0 ip_config]
</pre>
<p>Since the IP address of the unikernel is 192.168.1.2, before launching the unikernel, I do:</p>
<pre>echo "vif = [ 'mac=00:00:00:00:00:02,bridge=br0' ]" &gt;&gt; dns-client.xl
</pre>
<p>I build unikernel using the usual commands:</p>
<pre>mirage configure --xen
make depend; make; make run
# edit file.xl
sudo xl create -c file.xl
</pre>
<h4>Part&#160;1.2 &#8211; Getting Started</h4>
<p>The following is the complete code for a unikernel which queries a DNS server for a DNS domain and prints to console the IP address returned.</p>
<pre>open Lwt
open V1_LWT

let domain = "google.com"
let server = Ipaddr.V4.make 8 8 8 8

module Client (C:CONSOLE) (S:STACKV4) = struct

  module U = S.UDPV4
  module DNS = Dns_resolver_mirage.Make(OS.Time)(S)

  let start c s =
    let t = DNS.create s in
    OS.Time.sleep 2.0 
    &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
    C.log_s c ("Resolving " ^ domain)
    &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
    DNS.gethostbyname t ~server domain
    &gt;&gt;= fun rl -&gt;
    Lwt_list.iter_s
      (fun r -&gt;
         C.log_s c ("Answer " ^ (Ipaddr.to_string r))
      ) rl

end
</pre>
<p>This unikernel will query a DNS server at 8.8.8.8 (google public DNS resolver) for a domain google.com. Here we are using the simple function, DNS.gethostbyname, with the following type sig:</p>
<pre>  val gethostbyname : t -&gt;
    ?server:Ipaddr.V4.t -&gt; ?dns_port:int -&gt;
    ?q_class:Dns.Packet.q_class -&gt;
    ?q_type:Dns.Packet.q_type -&gt;
    string -&gt; Ipaddr.t list Lwt.t
</pre>
<p>This returns a list of IP&#8217;s, which we then iterative over with Lwt_list.iter_s and print to the console.</p>
<h4>Part&#160;1.3 &#8211;&#160;Boot time parameters</h4>
<p>Hardcoding the server and domain is far from ideal, instead we will provide them at boot time with Bootvar, the interface for bootvar is below:</p>
<pre>type t
(* read boot parameter line and store in assoc list - expected format is "key1=val1 key2=val2" *)
val create: unit -&gt; t Lwt.t

(* get boot parameter *)
val get: t -&gt; string -&gt; string option

(* get boot parameter, throws Not Found exception *)
val get_exn: t -&gt; string -&gt; string
</pre>
<p>We can now use this to provide domain and server at boot time instead of compile time</p>
<pre>let start c s =
    Bootvar.create () &gt;&gt;= fun bootvar -&gt;
    let domain = Bootvar.get_exn bootvar "domain" in
    let server = Ipaddr.V4.of_string_exn (Bootvar.get_exn bootvar "server") in
    ...
</pre>
<h4>Part&#160;1.4 &#8211; Using Resolve</h4>
<p>Now, a real DNS resolver will need to make many more parameters (any DNS query) and return full DNS responses not just IP address. Thus we need to move on from DNS.hostbyname to using the less abstract resolve function, resolve:</p>
<pre>  val resolve :
    (module Dns.Protocol.CLIENT) -&gt;
    t -&gt; Ipaddr.V4.t -&gt; int -&gt;
    Dns.Packet.q_class -&gt;
    Dns.Packet.q_type -&gt;
    Dns.Name.domain_name -&gt;
    Dns.Packet.t Lwt.t 
</pre>
<p>We can achieve same result of hostbyname as follows:</p>
<pre>...
    DNS.resolve (module Dns.Protocol.Client) t server 53 Q_IN Q_A (string_to_domain_name domain)
    &gt;&gt;= fun r -&gt;
    let ips =
    List.fold_left (fun a x -&gt;
      match x.rdata with
      | A ip -&gt; (Ipaddr.V4 ip) :: a
      | _ -&gt; a ) [] r.answers in
...
</pre>
<p>We are now explicit about parameters such as port, class and type. Note that we have opened the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/blob/master/lib/name.mli">Dns.Name</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/blob/master/lib/packet.mli">Dns.Packet.t</a> modules. The return value of resolve is a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/blob/master/lib/packet.mli">Dns.Packet.t</a>, we fold over answers in the produce an IPaddr.V4 list as with hostbyname. We can also use the to_string function in Packet to print</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken a break to do some refactoring work on the ocaml-dns library. In the next post, Part 2, we will expand our code to a DNS stub resolver.</p>

handling quotations that contain polymorphic let. The translation to
code-generating combinators represents a future-stage let-binding with
the present-staging lambda-binding, which is monomorphic. Even if
polymorphic lambda-bindings are allowed, they require type
annotations, which precludes the source-to-source translation.</p>

<p>We show the solution to the problem, using a different translation. It
works with the current OCaml. It also almost works in theory,
requiring a small extension to the relaxed value
restriction. Surprisingly, this extension seems to be exactly the one
needed to make the value restriction sound in a staged language with
reference cells and cross-stage-persistence.</p>

<p>The old, seems completely settled question of value restriction is
thrown deep-open in staged languages. We gain a profound problem to
work on.</p>

<h3>(Approximate) schedule</h3>

<p><strong>6pm</strong> Start, set up<br /><strong>6.30pm</strong> Talk<br /><strong>7pm</strong> Pizza<br /><strong>7.30pm-10pm</strong> Compiler hacking  </p>

<h3>Further details</h3>

<p><strong>Where</strong>:
  Room <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/openroommap/static/?s=FW11&amp;amp%3Blabels=1">FW11</a>, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/">Computer Laboratory, Madingley Road</a></p>

<p><strong>When</strong>: 6pm, Tuesday 10th February</p>

<p><strong>Who</strong>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><strong>What</strong>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals.</p>

<p><strong>Wiki</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki">https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</a></p>

<p>We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/libref/index.html">standard library</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html">runtime</a>, tools (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/depend.html">ocamldep</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc105">ocamllex</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc107">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual032.html">ocamlbuild</a>, the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html">documentation</a>, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience (see also some <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-previously-worked-on">things we've done on previous evenings</a>), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>We'll be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6pm.</p>

While a traditional VM would be a complete Linux system (kernel, init system, package manager, shell, etc), a Mirage unikernel is a single OCaml program which pulls in just the features (network driver, TCP stack, web server, etc) it needs as libraries.
Now it&#8217;s time to look at securing the system with HTTPS and access controls, ready for deployment.</p>

While a traditional VM would be a complete Linux system (kernel, init system, package manager, shell, etc), a Mirage unikernel is a single OCaml program which pulls in just the features (network driver, TCP stack, web server, etc) it needs as libraries.
Now it&#8217;s time to look at securing the system with HTTPS and access controls, ready for deployment.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As a quick reminder, the service (&#8220;Incoming queue&#8221;) accepts uploads from various contributors and queues them until the (firewalled) repository software downloads them, checks the GPG signatures, and merges them into the public software repository, signed with the repository&#8217;s key:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/0repo-multi.png" /></p>

<p>Although the queue service isn&#8217;t security critical, since the GPG signatures are made and checked elsewhere, I would like to ensure it has a few properties:</p>

<ul>  <li>Only the repository can fetch items from the queue.</li>
  <li>Only authorised users can upload to it.</li>
  <li>I can see where an upload came from and revoke access if necessary.</li>
  <li>An attacker cannot take control of the system and use it to attack other systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>We often think of security as a set of things we want to <em>prevent</em> - taking away possible actions from a fundamentally vulnerable underlying system (such as my original implementation, which had no security features).
But ideally I&#8217;d like every component of the system to be isolated by default, with allowed interactions (shown here by arrows) specified explicitly.
We should then be able to argue (informally) that the system will meet the goals above without having to verify that every line of code is correct.</p>

<p>My unikernel is written in OCaml and runs as a guest OS under the Xen hypervisor, so let&#8217;s look at how well those technologies support isolation first&#8230;</p>

<h2>OCaml</h2>

<p>I want to isolate the components of my unikernel, giving each just the access it requires.
When writing an OS, some unsafe code will occasionally be needed, but it should be clear which components use unsafe features (so they can be audited more carefully), and unsafe features shouldn&#8217;t be needed often.</p>

<p>For example, the code for handling an HTTP upload request should only be able to use our on-disk queue&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/blob/6ff713d353316447eda66b310adc42634accf98a/upload_queue.mli#L22">Uploader interface</a> and its own HTTP connection.
Then we would know that an attacker with upload permission can only cause new items to be added to the queue, no matter how buggy that code is.
It should not be able to read the web server&#8217;s private key, establish new out-bound connections, corrupt the disk, etc.</p>

<p>Like most modern languages, OCaml is memory-safe, so components can&#8217;t interfere with each other through buggy pointer arithmetic or unsafe casts of the kind commonly found in C code.</p>

<p>But we also need to avoid global variables, which would allow two components to communicate without us explicitly connecting them.
I can&#8217;t reason about the security of the system by looking at arrows in the architecture diagrams if unconnected components can magically create new arrows by themselves!
I&#8217;ve seen a few interesting approaches to this problem (please correct me if I&#8217;ve got this wrong):</p>

<dl>  <dt>Haskell</dt>
  <dd>Haskell avoids all side-effects, which makes global variables impossible (without using &#8220;unsafe&#8221; features), since updating them would be a side-effect.</dd>
  <dt>Rust</dt>
  <dd>Rust almost avoids the problem of globals through its ownership types.
Since only one thread can have a pointer to a mutable value at a time, mutable values can&#8217;t normally be global.
Rust does allow &#8220;mutable statics&#8221; (which contain only pointers to fixed data), but requires an explicit &#8220;unsafe&#8221; block to use them, which is good.</dd>
  <dt>E</dt>
  <dd>E allows modules to declare top-level variables, but each time the module is imported it creates a fresh copy.</dd>
</dl>

<p>OCaml does allow global variables, but by convention they are generally not used.</p>

<p>A second problem is controlling access to the outside world, including the network and disks (which you could consider to be more global variables):</p>

<dl>  <dt>Haskell</dt>
  <dd>Haskell doesn&#8217;t allow functions to access the outside world at all, but they can return an <code>IO</code> type if they want to do something (the caller must then pass this value up to the top level).
This makes it easy to see that e.g. evaluating a function &#8220;<code>uriPath :: URI -&gt; String</code>&#8221; cannot access the network.
However, it appears that all IO gets lumped in together: a value of type <code>IO String</code> may cause any side-effects at all (disk, network, etc), so the entire side-effecting part of the program needs to be audited.</dd>
  <dt>Rust</dt>
  <dd>Rust allows all code full access to the system via its standard library.
For example, any code can read or write any file.</dd>
  <dt>E</dt>
  <dd>E passes all access to the outside world to the program&#8217;s entry point.
For example, <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> grants access to the file system and <code>&lt;unsafe&gt;</code> grants access to all unsafe features.
These can be passed to libraries to grant them access, and can be attenuated (wrapped) to provide limited access.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>main.e </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="java"><span class="line"><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">queue</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nl">import:</span><span class="n">makeQueue</span><span class="o">&gt;(&lt;</span><span class="nl">file:</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">myprog</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">queue</span><span class="o">&gt;)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Here, <code>queue</code> has read-write access to the <code>/var/myprog/queue</code> sub-tree (and nothing else).
It also has no way to share data with any other parts of the program, including other queues.</p>

<p>Like Rust, OCaml does not limit access to the outside world.
However, Mirage itself uses E-style dependency injection everywhere, with the unikernel&#8217;s <code>start</code> function being passed all external resources as arguments:</p>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Because everything in Mirage is defined using abstract types, libraries always expect to be passed the things they need explicitly.
We know that <code>Upload_queue</code> above won&#8217;t access a block device directly because it needs to support different kinds of block device.</p>

<p>OCaml <em>does</em> enforce its abstractions.
There&#8217;s no way for the <code>Upload_queue</code> to discover that <code>block</code> is really a Xen block device with some extra functionality
(as a Java program might do with <code>if (block instanceof XenBlock)</code>, for example).
This means that we can reason about the limits of what functions may do by looking only at their type signatures.</p>

<p>The use of functors means you can attenuate access as desired.
For example, if we want to grant just part of <code>block</code> to the queue then we can create our own module implementing the <code>BLOCK</code> type that exposes just some partition of the device, and pass that to the <code>Upload_queue.Make</code> functor.</p>

<p>In summary then, we can reason about security fairly well in Mirage if we assume the libraries are not malicious, but we cannot make hard guarantees.
It should be possible to check with automatic static analysis that we&#8217;re not using any &#8220;unsafe&#8221; features such as global variables, direct access to devices, or allocating uninitialised memory, but I don&#8217;t know of any tools to do that (except <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/emilyWalnut.html">Emily</a>, but that seems to be just a proof-of-concept).
But these issues are minor: any reasonably safe modern language will be a huge improvement over legacy C or C++ systems!</p>

<h2>Xen</h2>

<p>The Xen hypervisor allows multiple guest operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
It is used by many cloud hosting providers, including Amazon&#8217;s AWS.
I run it on my CubieTruck - a small ARM board.
Xen allows me to run my unikernel on the same machine as other services, but ideally with the same security properties as if it had its own dedicated machine.
If some other guest on the machine is compromised, it shouldn&#8217;t affect my unikernel, and if the unikernel is compromised then it shouldn&#8217;t affect other guests.</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper center"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/xen.png" title="A typical Xen deployment, running four domains." width="" /><span class="caption-text">A typical Xen deployment, running four domains.</span></span></p>

<p>The diagram above shows a deployment with Linux and Mirage guests. Only dom0 has access to the physical hardware; the other guests only see virtual devices, provided by dom0.</p>

<p>How secure is Xen?
The <a href="http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/">Xen security advisories</a> page shows that there are about 3 new Xen advisories each month.
However, it&#8217;s hard to compare programs this way because the number of vulnerabilities reported depends greatly on the number of people using the program, whether they use it for security-critical tasks, and how seriously the project takes problems (e.g. whether a denial-of-service attack is considered a security bug).</p>

<p>I started using Xen in April 2014.
These are the security problems I&#8217;ve found myself so far:</p>

<dl>  <dt><a href="http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-93.html">XSA-93</a> Hardware features unintentionally exposed to guests on ARM</dt>
  <dd>While trying to get Mini-OS to boot, I tried implementing ARM&#8217;s recommended boot code for invalidating the cache
(at startup, you should invalidate the cache, dropping any previous contents).
When running under a hypervisor this should be a null-op since the cache is always valid by the time a guest is running, but Xen allowed the operation to go ahead, discarding pending writes by the hypervisor and other guests and crashing the system.
This could probably be used for a successful attack.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-94.html">XSA-94</a> : Hypervisor crash setting up GIC on arm32</dt>
  <dd>I tried to program an out-of-range register, causing the hypervisor to dereference a null pointer and panic.
This is just a denial of service (the host machine needs to be rebooted); it shouldn&#8217;t allow access to other VMs.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-95.html">XSA-95</a> : Input handling vulnerabilities loading guest kernel on ARM</dt>
  <dd>I got the length wrong when creating the zImage for the unikernel (I included the .bss section in the length).
The <code>xl create</code> tool didn&#8217;t notice and tried to read the extra data, causing the tool to segfault.
You could use this to read a bit of private data from the <code>xl</code> process, but it&#8217;s unlikely there would be anything useful there.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Although that&#8217;s more bugs than you might expect, note that they&#8217;re all specific to the relatively new ARM support.
The second and third are both due to using C, and would have been avoided in a safer language.
I&#8217;m not really sure why the &#8220;xl&#8221; tool needs to be in C - that seems to be asking for trouble.</p>

<p>To drive the physical hardware, Xen runs the first guest (dom0) with access to everything.
This is usually Linux, and I had various problems with that. For example:</p>

<dl>  <dt><a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2014-08/msg00053.html">Bug sharing the same page twice</a></dt>
  <dd>Linux got confused when the unikernel shared the same page twice (it split a single page of RAM into multiple TCP segments).
This wasn&#8217;t a security bug (I think), but after it was fixed, I then got:</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2014-08/msg00596.html">Page still granted</a></dt>
  <dd>If my unikernel sent a network packet and then exited quickly, dom0 would get stuck and I&#8217;d have to reboot.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/talex5/linux/commit/6b6dcc2857d84070c94fe4e3498486337d292870">Oops if network is used too quickly</a></dt>
  <dd>The Linux dom0 initialises the virtual network device while the VM is booting.
My unikernel booted fast enough to send packets before the device structure had been fully filled in, leading to an oops.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2014-09/msg02254.html">Linux Dom0 oops and reboot on indirect block requests</a></dt>
  <dd>Sending lots of block device requests to Linux dom0 from the unikernel would cause Linux to oops in <code>swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single</code> and reboot the host.
I wasn&#8217;t the first to find this though, and backporting the patch from Linux 3.17 seemed to fix it (I don&#8217;t actually know what the problem was).</dd>
</dl>

<p>So it might seem that using Xen doesn&#8217;t get us very far.
We&#8217;re still running Linux in dom0, and it still has full access to the machine.
For example, a malicious network packet from outside or from a guest might still give an attacker full control of the machine.
Why not just use <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM</a> and run the guests under Linux directly?</p>

<p>The big (potential) advantage of Xen here is <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Dom0_Disaggregation">Dom0 Disaggregation</a>.
With this, Dom0 gives control of different pieces of physical hardware to different VMs rather than driving them itself.
For example, <a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/">Qubes</a> (a security-focused desktop OS using Xen) runs a separate &#8220;<a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/QubesNet">NetVM</a>&#8221; Linux guest just to handle the network device.
This is connected only to the <a href="https://qubes-os.org/wiki/QubesFirewall">FirewallVM</a> - another Linux guest that just routes packets to other VMs.</p>

<p>This is interesting for two reasons.
First, if an attacker exploits a bug in the network device driver, they&#8217;re still outside your firewall.
Secondly, it provides a credible path to replacing parts of Linux with alternative implementations, possibly written in safer languages.
You could, for example, have Linux running dom0 but use FreeBSD to drive the network card, Mirage to provide the firewall, and OpenBSD to handle USB.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#8217;s worth noting that Mirage is not tied to Xen, but can target various systems (mainly Unix and Xen currently, but there is some JavaScript support too).
If it turns out that e.g. <a href="http://genode.org/about/challenges">Genode on seL4</a> (a formally verified microkernel) provides better security, we should be able to support that too.</p>

<h2>Transport Layer Security</h2>

<p>We won&#8217;t get far securing the system while attackers can read and modify our communications.
The <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/">ocaml-tls</a> project provides an OCaml implementation of TLS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a>), and
in September <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2014-09/msg00100.html">Hannes Mehnert showed it running on Mirage/Xen/ARM devices</a>.
Given the various flaws exposed recently in popular C TLS libraries, an OCaml implementation is very welcome.
Getting the Xen support in a state where it could be widely used took a bit of work, but
I&#8217;ve submitted all the patches I made, so it should be easier for other people now - see <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev/pull/52">https://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev/pull/52</a>.</p>

<h3>C stubs for Xen</h3>

<p>TLS needs some C code for the low-level cryptographic functions, which have to be constant time to avoid leaking information about the key, so first I had to make packages providing versions of libgmp, ctypes, zarith and nocrypto compiled to run in kernel mode.</p>

<p>The reason you need to compile C programs specially to run in kernel mode is because on x86 processors user mode code can assume the existence of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">red zone</a>, which allows some optimisations that aren&#8217;t safe in kernel mode.</p>

<h3>Ethernet frame alignment</h3>

<p>The Mirage network driver sends Ethernet frames to dom0 by sharing pages of memory.
Each frame must therefore be contained in a single page.
The TLS code was (correctly) passing a large buffer to the TCP layer, which <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2015-01/msg00029.html">incorrectly</a> asked the network device to send each TCP-sized chunk of it.
Chunks overlapping page boundaries then got rejected.</p>

<p>My previous experiments with <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/10/27/visualising-an-asynchronous-monad/#udp-transmission">tracing the network layer</a> had shown that we actually share two pages for each packet: one for the IP header and one for the payload.
Doing this avoids the need to copy the data to a new buffer, but adds the overhead of granting and revoking access to both pages.
I modified the network driver to copy the data into a single block inside a single page and got <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/pull/17">a large speed boost</a>.
Indeed, it got so much faster that it triggered <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/pull/16">a bug handling full transmit buffers</a> - which made it initially appear slower!</p>

<p>In addition to fixing the alignment problem when using TLS, and being faster, this has a nice security benefit:
the only data shared with the network driver domain is data explicitly sent to it.
Before, we had to share the entire page of memory containing the application&#8217;s buffer, and there was no way to know what else might have been there.
This offers some protection if the network driver domain is compromised.</p>

<h3>HTTP API</h3>

<p>My original code configured a plain HTTP server on port 8080 like this:</p>

<p><code>stack</code> creates TCP/IP stack.
<code>conduit_direct</code> can dynamically select different transports (e.g. http or vchan).
<code>http_server</code> applies the configuration to the conduit to get an HTTP server using plain HTTP.</p>

<p>I added support to <code>Conduit_mirage</code> to let it wrap any underlying conduit with TLS.
However, the configuration needed for TLS is fairly complicated, and involves a secret key which must be protected.
Therefore, I switched to creating only the <code>conduit</code> in <code>config.ml</code> and having the unikernel itself load the key and certificate by copying a local &#8220;keys&#8221; directory into the unikernel image as a &#8220;crunch&#8221; filesystem:</p>

<p>This runs a secure HTTPS server on port 8443.
The rest of the code is as before.</p>

<h3>The private key</h3>

<p>The next question is where to store the real private key.
The examples provided by the TLS package compile it into the unikernel image using crunch, but it&#8217;s common to keep unikernel binaries in Git repositories and people don&#8217;t expect kernel images to contain secrets.
In a traditional Linux system, we&#8217;d store the private key on the disk, so I decided to try the same here.
(I did think about storing the key encrypted in the unikernel and storing the password on the disk so you&#8217;d need both to get the key, but the TLS library doesn&#8217;t support encrypted keys yet.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t use a regular filesystem for my queuing service, and I wouldn&#8217;t want to share it with the key if I did, so instead I reserved a separate 4KB partition of the disk for the key.
It turned out that Mirage already has partitioning support in the form of the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-mbr">ocaml-mbr</a> library.
I didn&#8217;t actually create an MBR at the start, but just used the <a href="https://github.com/talex5/ocaml-mbr/blob/master/lib/mbr_partition.mli"><code>Mbr_partition</code></a> functor to wrap the underlying block device into two parts.
The configuration looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/queue-baseline.png" /></p>

<p>How safe is this?
I don&#8217;t want to audit all the code for handling the queue, and I shouldn&#8217;t have to: we can see from the diagram that the only components with access to the key are the disk, the partitions and the TLS library.
We need to trust that the TLS library will protect the key (not easy, but that&#8217;s its job) and that <code>queue_partition</code> won&#8217;t let <code>queue</code> access the part of the disk with the key.</p>

<p>We also need to trust the disk, but if the partitions are only allowing correct requests through, that shouldn&#8217;t be too much to ask.</p>

<h3>The partition code</h3>

<p>Before relying on the partition code, we&#8217;d better take a look at it because it may not be designed to enforce security.
Indeed, a quick look at the code shows that it isn&#8217;t:</p>

<p>It checks only that the requested start sector plus the length of the results buffer is less than the length of the partition.
To (hopefully) make this bullet-proof, I:</p>

<ul>  <li>moved the checks into a single function so we don&#8217;t have to check two copies,</li>
  <li>added a check that the start sector isn&#8217;t negative,</li>
  <li>modified the end check to avoid integer overflow, and</li>
  <li>added some unit-tests.</li>

<p>The need to protect against overflow is an annoyance.
OCaml&#8217;s <code>Int64.(add max_int one)</code> doesn&#8217;t abort, but returns <code>Int64.min_int</code>.
That&#8217;s disappointing, but not surprising.
I wrote a unit-test that tried to read sector <code>Int64.max_int</code> and ran it (before updating the code) to check it detected the problem.
I was expecting the partition code to pass the request to the underlying block device, which I expected to return an error about the invalid sector, but it didn&#8217;t!
It turns out, <code>Int64.to_int</code> (used by my in-memory test block device) silently truncates out-of-range integers:</p>

<pre><code># Int64.max_int;;
- : int64 = 9223372036854775807L
# Int64.(add max_int one);;
- : int64 = -9223372036854775808L
# Int64.min_int;;
- : int64 = -9223372036854775808L
# Int64.(to_int min_int);;
- : int = 0
</code></pre>

<p>So, if the queue can be tricked into asking for sector 9223372036854775807 then the partition would accept it as valid and the block device would truncate it and give access to sector 0 - the sector with the private key!</p>

<p>Still, this is a nice demonstration of how we can add security in Mirage by inserting a new module (<code>Mbr_partition</code>) between two existing ones.
Rather than having some complicated fixed policy language (e.g. SELinux), we can build whatever security abstractions we like.
Here I just limited which parts of the disk the queue could access, but we could do many other things: make a partition read-only, make it readable only until the unikernel finishes initialising, apply rate-limiting on reads, etc.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the final code. It:</p>

<ol>  <li>Takes a block device, a conduit, and a KV store as inputs.</li>
  <li>Creates two partitions (views) onto the block device.</li>
  <li>Creates a queue on one partition.</li>
  <li>Reads the private key from the other, and the certificate from the KV store.</li>
  <li>Begins serving HTTPS requests.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Entropy</h3>

<p>Another issue is getting good random numbers, which is required for the cryptography.
On start-up, the unikernel displayed:</p>

<pre><code>Entropy_xen_weak: using a weak entropy source seeded only from time.
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this, you need to use <a href="https://github.com/djs55/mirage-entropy">Dave Scott&#8217;s version</a> (with a slight patch from me):</p>

<pre><code>opam pin add mirage-entropy-xen 'https://github.com/talex5/mirage-entropy.git#handshake'
</code></pre>

<p>You should then see:</p>

<pre><code>Entropy_xen: attempting to connect to Xen entropy source org.openmirage.entropy.1
Console.connect org.openmirage.entropy.1: doesn't currently exist, waiting for hotplug
</code></pre>

<p>Now run <a href="https://github.com/mirage/xentropyd">xentropyd</a> in dom0 to share the host&#8217;s entropy with guests.</p>

<p>The interesting question here is what Linux guests do for entropy, especially on ARM where there&#8217;s no <code>RdRand</code> instruction.</p>

<h2>Access control</h2>

<p>Traditional means of access control involve issuing users with passwords or X.509 client certificates, which they share with the software they&#8217;re running.
All requests sent by the client can then be authenticated as coming from them and approved based on some access control policy.
This approach leads to all the well-known problems with traditional access control: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy problem</a>, Cross-Site Request Forgery, Clickjacking, etc, so I want to avoid that kind of &#8220;ambient authority&#8221;.</p>

<p>The previous diagram let us reason about how the different components within the unikernel could interact with each other, showing the possible (initial) interactions with arrows.
Now I want to stretch arrows across the Internet, so I can reason in the same way about the larger distributed system that includes my queue service with the uploaders and downloaders.</p>

<p>Like C pointers, traditional web URLs do not give us what we want: a compromised CA anywhere in the world will allow an attacker to impersonate our service, and our URLs may be guessable.
Instead, I decided to try a <a href="http://www.waterken.com/dev/YURL/Definition/">YURL</a>:</p>

<blockquote>  <p>&#8221;[&#8230;] the identifier MUST provide enough information to: locate the target site; authenticate the target site; and, if required, establish a private communication channel with the target site. A URL that meets these requirements is a YURL.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The latest version of this (draft) scheme I could find was some brief notes in <a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/HTTPSY_%E2%80%93_Leave_the_Certificate_Authority_Behind">HTTPSY</a> (2014), which uses the format:</p>

<pre><code>httpsy://algorithm:fingerprint@domain:port/path1/!redactedPath2/&#8230;
</code></pre>

<p>There are two parts we need to consider: how the client determines that it is connected to the real service, and how the service determines what the client can do.</p>

<p>To let the client authenticate the server without relying on the CA system, YURLs include a hash (fingerprint) of the server&#8217;s public key.
You can get the fingerprint of an X509 certificate like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl x509 -in server.pem -fingerprint -sha256 -noout
SHA256 Fingerprint=3F:27:2D:E6:D6:3D:7C:08:E0:E3:EF:02:A8:DA:9A:74:62:84:57:21:B4:72:39:FD:D0:72:0E:76:71:A5:E9:94
</code></pre>

<p>Base32-encoding shortens this to <code>h4ts3zwwhv6aryhd54bkrwu2orriivzbwrzdt7oqoihhm4nf5gka</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, to get the value with OCaml, use:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="nn">Certificate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">cs_of_cert</span> <span class="n">cert</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Nocrypto</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nn">Hash</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">digest</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">SHA256</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>To control what each user of the service can do, we give each user a unique YURL containing a <a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Swiss_number">Swiss number</a>, which is like a password except that it applies only to a specific resource, not to the whole site.
The Swiss number comes after the <code>!</code> in the URL, which indicates to browsers that it shouldn&#8217;t be displayed, included in Referer headers, etc.
You can use any unguessably long random string here (I used <code>pwgen 32 1</code>).
After checking the server&#8217;s fingerprint, the client requests the path with the Swiss number included.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, then, a sample URL to give to the downloader looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>httpsy://sha256:h4ts3zwwhv6aryhd54bkrwu2orriivzbwrzdt7oqoihhm4nf5gka@10.0.0.2:8443/downloader/!eequuthieyexahzahShain0abeiwaej4
</code></pre>

<p>The old code for handling requests looked like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>I hashed the Swiss number here so that the unikernel doesn&#8217;t have to contain any secrets and I therefore don&#8217;t have to worry about timing attacks.
Even if the attacker knows the hash we&#8217;re looking for, they still shouldn&#8217;t be able to generate a URL which hashes to that value.</p>

<p>By giving each user of the service a different Swiss number we can keep records of who authorised each request and revoke access individually if needed (here the <code>~user:"Alice"</code> indicates this is the uploader URL we gave to Alice).</p>

<p>Of course, the YURLs need to be sent to users securely too.
In my case, the users already have known GPG keys, so I can just email them an encrypted version.</p>

<h3>Python client</h3>

<p>The downloader (0repo) is written in Python, so the next step was to check that it could still access the service.
The Python SSL API was rather confusing, but this seems to work:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>MirageOS should allow us to build systems that are far more secure than traditional operating systems.
By starting with isolated components and then connecting them together in a controlled way we can feel some confidence that our security goals will be met.</p>

<p>At the language level, OCaml&#8217;s abstract types and functors make it easy to reason informally about how the components of our system will interact. Mirage passes values granting access to the outside world (disks, network cards, etc) to our unikernel&#8217;s <code>start</code> function.
Our code can then delegate these permissions to the rest of the code in a controlled fashion.
For example, we can grant the queuing code access only to its part of the disk (and not the bit containing the TLS private key) by wrapping the disk in a partition functor.
Although OCaml doesn&#8217;t actually prevent us from bypassing this system and accessing devices directly, code that does so would not be able to support the multiple different back-ends (e.g. Unix and Xen) that Mirage requires and so could not be written accidentally.
It should be possible for a static analysis tool to verify that modules don&#8217;t do this.</p>

<p>Moving up a level from separating the components of our unikernel, Xen allows us to isolate multiple unikernels and other VMs running on a single physical host.
Just as we interposed a disk partition between the queue and the disk within the unikernel, we can use Xen to interpose a firewall VM between the physical network device and our unikernel.</p>

<p>Finally, the use of transport layer security and YURLs allows us to continue this pattern of isolation to the level of networks, so that we can reason in the same way about distributed systems.
My current code mixes the handling of YURLs with the existing application logic, but it should be possible to abstract this and make it reusable, so that remote services appear just like any local service.
In many systems this is awkward because local APIs are used synchronously while remote ones are asynchronous, but in Mirage everything is non-blocking anyway, so there is no difference.</p>

<p>I feel I should put some kind of warning here about these very new security features not being ready for real use and how you should instead use mature, widely deployed systems such as Linux and OpenSSL.
But really, can it be any worse?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve spotted any flaws in my reasoning or code, please add comments!
The code for this unikernel can be found on the <code>tls</code> branch at <a href="https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/tree/tls">https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/tree/tls</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>There is other work besides those I&#8217;ve mentioned and I think by any measure,
all the projects have been quite successful. As the community continues to
develop, it&#8217;s important to clarify how things currently work to improve the
level of transparency and make it easier for newcomers to get involved.</p>

<h3>Factors for a governance framework</h3>

<p>For the last couple of months, I&#8217;ve been looking over how larger projects
manage themselves and the governance documents that are available. My aim has
been to put such a document together for the OCaml.org domain without
introducing burdensome processes.  There are number of things that stood out
to me during this process, which have guided the approach I&#8217;m taking.</p>

<p>My considerations for an OCaml.org governance document:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>A governance document is not <em>necessary</em> for success but it&#8217;s valuable to
demonstrate a commitment to a <strong>stable decision-making process</strong>.  There are
many projects that progress perfectly well without any documented processes
and indeed the work around OCaml.org so far is a good example of this (as well
as OCaml itself).  However, for projects to achieve a scale greater than the
initial teams, it&#8217;s a significant benefit to encode in writing how things work
(NB: please note that I didn&#8217;t define the <em>type</em> of decision-making process -
merely that it&#8217;s a stable one).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>It must <strong>clarify its scope</strong> so that there is no confusion about what the
document covers. In the case of OCaml.org, it needs to be clear that the
governance covers the domain itself, rather than referring to the website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>It should <strong>document the reality</strong>, rather than represent an aspirational
goal or what people <em>believe</em> a governance structure should look like.  It&#8217;s
very tempting to think of an idealised structure without recognising that
behaviours and norms have <em>already</em> been established. Sometimes this will be
vague and poorly defined but that might simply indicate areas that the
community hasn&#8217;t encountered yet (e.g it&#8217;s uncommon for any new project to
seriously think about dispute resolution processes until they have to).  In
this sense, the initial version of a governance document should simply be a
written description of how things currently stand, rather than a means to
adjust that behaviour.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>It should be <strong>simple and self-contained</strong>, so that anyone can understand
the intent quickly without recourse to other documents.  It may be tempting to
consider every edge-case or try to resolve every likely ambiguity but this
just leads to large, legal documents.  This approach may well be necessary
once projects have reached a certain scale but to implement it sooner would be
a case of premature optimisation &#8212; not to mention that very few people would 
read and remember such a document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>It&#8217;s a <strong>living document</strong>. If the community decides that it would prefer a
new arrangement, then the document conveniently provides a stable starting
point from which to iterate. Indeed, it <em>should</em> adapt along with the project
that it governs. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the above points in mind, I&#8217;ve been putting together a draft governance
framework to cover how the OCaml.org domain name is managed.  It&#8217;s been a
quiet work-in-progress for some time and I&#8217;ll be getting in touch with
maintainers of specific projects soon.  Once I&#8217;ve had a round of reviews, I&#8217;ll
be sharing it more widely and posting it here!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many asynchronous programs make use of <em>promises</em> (also known as using <em>light-weight threads</em> or an <em>asynchronous monad</em>).
A promise/thread is a place-holder for a value that will arrive in the future.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a really simple example (an OCaml program using <a href="http://ocsigen.org/lwt/">Lwt</a>).
It creates a thread that resolves to unit (void) after one second:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 106px"></canvas>

<p>In the diagram, time runs from left to right.
Threads (promises) are shown as horizontal lines.
The diagram shows:</p>

<ul>  <li>Initially, only the main thread (&#8220;0&#8221;) is present.</li>
  <li>The main thread then creates a new thread, labelled &#8220;sleep&#8221;.</li>
  <li>The sleep thread is a &#8220;task&#8221; thread (this is just a helpful label added when the thread is created).</li>
  <li>The whole process then goes to sleep for one second, which is shown by the darker background.</li>
  <li>At the end of the second, the process wakes up and resolves the sleep thread to its value (unit), shown by the green arrow.</li>
  <li>The main thread, which was waiting for the sleep thread, reads the value (the blue arrow) and exits the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you zoom in on the arrows (go down to a grid division of about 10 microseconds), you&#8217;ll also see a white segment on the main thread, which shows when it was running (only one thread runs at a time).</p>

<p>Because thread 0 is actually the main event loop (rather than a Lwt thread), things are a little more complicated than normal.
When the process has nothing to do, thread 0 puts the process to sleep until the next scheduled timer.
When the OS wakes the process, thread 0 resumes, determines that the &#8220;sleep&#8221; thread can be resolved, and does so.
This causes any callbacks registered on the sleep thread to be called, but in this case there aren&#8217;t any and control returns to thread 0.
Thread 0 then checks the sleep thread (because that determines when to finish), and ends the loop because it&#8217;s resolved.</p>

<h3>Bind</h3>

<p>Callbacks can be attached to a promise/thread to process the value when it arrives.
Attaching the callback immediately creates a new promise for the final result of the callback.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a program that sleeps twice in series.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> (bind) operator attaches the callback function to the first thread.
I&#8217;ve made the sleeps very short so you can see the process waking up without having to zoom.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">example_2</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">sleep</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">00001</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;=</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">sleep</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">00001</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 136px"></canvas>

<p>In this case, the main thread creates two new threads at the start: one for the result of the first sleep and a second (&#8220;bind&#8221;) for the result of running the callback on the result.
It&#8217;s easier to see how the first thread is resolved here: the main thread handling the polling loop wakes up and resolves the sleep thread, which then causes the bind thread to resume.</p>

<p>You might wonder why the bind thread disappears when the second sleep starts.
It hasn&#8217;t finished, but when the bind&#8217;s callback function returns the second sleep thread as its result, the bind thread is merged with the sleep thread.
This is the asynchronous equivalent of a tail call optimisation, allowing us to create loops without needing an unbounded number of threads.</p>

<p>Actually, displaying binds in this way tends to clutter up the diagrams, so the viewer has a simplification rule that is enabled by default: if the first event on a bind thread is a read, the part of the bind up to that point isn&#8217;t drawn.
Therefore, the default display for this program is:</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 106px"></canvas>

<p>If you zoom in on the central green arrow, you can see the tiny remaining bind thread between the two sleeps.</p>

<h3>Join</h3>

<p><code>Lwt.join</code> waits for a collection of threads to finish:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">example_3</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">join</span> <span class="o">[</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="n">sleep</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">003</span><span class="o">;</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 196px"></canvas>

<p>In the trace, you can see the join thread being notified each time one of the threads it&#8217;s waiting for completes.
When they&#8217;re all done, it resolves itself.</p>

<h3>Choose</h3>

<p><code>Lwt.choose</code> is similar to join, but only waits until one of its threads finishes:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">choose</span> <span class="o">[</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="n">sleep</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">003</span><span class="o">;</span>

</span><span class="line">    <span class="n">sleep</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">002</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 196px"></canvas>

<p>I cheated a bit here.
To avoid clutter, the viewer only draws each thread until its last recorded event (without this, threads that get garbage collected span the whole width of the trace), so I used <code>Profile.label ~thread "(continues)"</code> to create extra label events on the two remaining threads to make it clearer what&#8217;s happening here.</p>

<h3>Pick</h3>

<p><code>Lwt.pick</code> is similar to choose, but additionally cancels the other threads:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 196px"></canvas>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Failed threads are shown with a red bar at the end and the exception message is displayed.
Also, any &#8220;reads&#8221; arrow coming from it is shown in red rather than blue.
Here, the bind thread fails but the try one doesn&#8217;t because it catches the exception and returns unit.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Note: I&#8217;m using the Lwt syntax extension here for <code>try_lwt</code>, but you can use <code>Lwt.try_bind</code> if you prefer.</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 106px"></canvas>

<p>The same simplification done for &#8220;bind&#8221; threads also applies to &#8220;try&#8221; threads, so the try thread doesn&#8217;t appear at all until you zoom in on the red arrow.</p>

<h2>Making your own traces</h2>

<p>Update: These instructions were out-of-date so I&#8217;ve removed them. See the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile">mirage-profile</a> page for up-to-date instructions.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I made <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/07/28/my-first-unikernel/">my first unikernel</a> - a REST service for queuing files as a Xen guest OS.
Unlike a normal guest, which would include a Linux kernel, init system, libc, shell, Apache, etc, a Mirage unikernel is a single executable, and almost pure OCaml (apart from malloc, the garbage collector, etc).
Unikernels can be very small and simple, and have a much smaller attack surface than traditional systems.</p>

<p>For my first attempt at <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/08/15/optimising-the-unikernel/">optimising the unikernel</a>, I used OCaml&#8217;s built-in profiling support.
This recorded function calls and how much time was spent in each one.
But I quickly discovered that CPU time was rarely the important factor - how the various asynchronous threads were scheduled was more important, and the tracing made it difficult to see this.</p>

<p>So, let&#8217;s see how the new tracing does on my previous problems&#8230;</p>

<h3>Profiling the console</h3>

<p>In the previous profiling post, I generated this graph using libreoffice:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/xen-console-messages.png" /></p>

<p>As a reminder, Xen guests output to the console by writing the text to a shared memory page, increasing a counter to indicate this, and signalling dom0. The console logger in dom0 reads the data, increments another counter to confirm it got it, and signals back to the guest that that part of the buffer is free again.</p>

<p>To use the new tracing system, I added a <code>Profile.note_increase "sent" len</code> to the main loop, which increments a &#8220;sent&#8221; count on each iteration (i.e. each time we write a line to the console).
The viewer adds a mark on the trace for each increment and overlays a graph (the red line) so you can see overall progress easily:</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 300px"></canvas>
<p><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/javascripts/trace-viewer.html?trace=console">View full screen</a> | <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/data/traces/console.sexp">Download console.sexp</a></p>

<p>As before, we can see that we send messages rapidly in bursts, followed by long periods without progress.
Zooming in to the places where the red line is increasing, we can see the messages being written to the buffer without any delays.
Looking at the edges of the sleeping regions, it&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;re simply waiting for Xen to notify us of space by signalling us on event channel 2.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the complete test code:</p>

<h3>UDP transmission</h3>

<p>Last time, we saw packet transmission being interrupted by periods of sleeping, garbage collection, and some brief but mysterious pauses.
I noted that the GC tended to run during <code>Ring.ack_responses</code>, suggesting that was getting called quite often, and with the new tracing we can see why.</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/udp-packets.png" /></p>

<p>This trace shows a unikernel booting (scroll left if you want to see that) and then sending 10 UDP packets.
I&#8217;ve left the trace running a little longer so you can see the acks (this is very obvious when sending more than 10 packets, but I wanted to keep this trace small):</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 700px"></canvas>
<p><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/javascripts/trace-viewer.html?trace=udp">View full screen</a> | <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/data/traces/udp.sexp">Download udp.sexp</a></p>

<p>Mirage creates two threads for each packet that we add to the ring buffer and they stick around until we get a notification back from dom0 that the packet has been read (actually, we create six threads for each packet, but the bind simplification hides four of them).</p>

<p>It looks like each packet is in two parts, as each one generates two acks, one much later than the other.
I think the two parts are the UDP header and the payload, which each have their own IO page.
Given the time needed to share and unshare pages, it would probably be more efficient to copy the payload into the same page as the header.
Interestingly, dom0 seems to ack all the headers first, but holds on to the payload pages for longer.</p>

<p>With 20 threads for just ten packets, you can imagine that the trace gets rather crowded when sending thousands!</p>

<h3>TCP transmission</h3>

<p>As before, the TCP picture is rather complicated:</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 700px"></canvas>
<p><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/javascripts/trace-viewer.html?trace=tcp">View full screen</a> | <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/data/traces/tcp.sexp">Download tcp.sexp</a></p>

<p>The above shows a unikernel running on my ARM Cubietruck connecting to netcat on my laptop and sending 100 TCP packets over the stream.
There are three counters here:</p>

<ul>  <li><code>main-to-tcp</code> (purple) is incremented by the main thread just before sending a block of data to the TCP stream (just enough to fill one TCP segment).</li>
  <li><code>tcp-to-ip</code> (red) shows when the TCP system sent a segment to the IP layer for transmission.</li>
  <li><code>tcp-ackd-segs</code> (orange) shows when the TCP system got confirmation of receipt from the remote host (note: a TCP ask is not the same as a dom0 ring ack, which just says the network driver has accepted the segment for transmission).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is clearly scope to improve the viewer here, but a few things can be seen already.
The general cycle is:</p>

<ul>  <li>The unikernel is sleeping, waiting for TCP acks.</li>
  <li>The remote end acks some packets (the orange line goes up).</li>
  <li>The TCP layer transmits some of the buffered packets (red line goes up).</li>
  <li>The TCP layer allows the main code to send more data (purple line goes up).</li>
  <li>The transmitted pages are freed (the dense vertical green lines) once Xen acks them.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did wonder whether we unshared the pages as soon as dom0 had read the segment, or only when the remote end sent the TCP ack.
Having the graphs overlaid on the trace lets us answer this question - you can see that when the red line goes up (segments sent to dom0), the <code>ring.write</code> thread that is created then ends (and the page is unshared) in response to <code>ring.poll ack_responses</code>, before the TCP acks arrive.</p>

<p>TCP starts slowly, but as the window size gets bigger and more packets are transmitted at a time, the sleeping periods get shorter and then disappear as the process becomes CPU-bound.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a long garbage collection period near the end (shortly before we close the socket).
This might be partly the fault of the tracing system, which currently allocates lots of small values, rather than writing to a preallocated buffer.</p>

<h3>Disk access</h3>

<p>For our final example, let&#8217;s revisit the block device profiling from last time.
Back then, making a series of read requests, each for 32 pages of data, produced this chart:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/block-reads-1-32.png" /></p>

<p>With the new tracing, we can finally see what those mysterious wake-ups in the middle are:</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 500px"></canvas>
<p><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/javascripts/trace-viewer.html?trace=disk-direct">View full screen</a> | <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/data/traces/disk-direct.sexp">Download disk-direct.sexp</a></p>

<p>Each time the main test code&#8217;s read call returns, the orange trace (&#8220;read&#8221;) goes up.
You can see that we make three blocking calls to dom0 for each request.
I added another counter for the number of active grant refs (pages shared with dom0), shown as the red line (&#8220;gntref&#8221;).
You can see that for each call we share a bunch of pages, wait, and then unshare them all again.</p>

<p>In each group of three, we share 11 pages for the first two requests, but only 10 for the third.
This makes obvious what previously required a careful reading of the block code: requests for more than 11 pages have to be split up because that&#8217;s all you can fit in the request structure.
Our request for 32 pages is split into requests for 11 + 11 + 10 pages, which are sent in series.</p>

<p>In fact, Xen also supports &#8220;indirect&#8221; requests, where the request structure references full pages of requests.
I added support for this to mirage-block-xen, which improved the speed nicely.
Here&#8217;s a trace with indirect requests enabled:</p>

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 500px"></canvas>
<p><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/javascripts/trace-viewer.html?trace=disk-indirect">View full screen</a> | <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/data/traces/disk-indirect.sexp">Download disk-indirect.sexp</a></p>

<p>If you zoom in where the red line starts to rise, you can see it has 32 steps, as we allocate all the pages in one go, followed by a final later increment for the indirect page.</p>

<p>Zooming out, you can see we paused for GC a little later.
We got lucky here, with the GC occurring just after we sent the request and just before we started waiting for the reply, so it hardly slowed us down.
If we&#8217;d been unlucky the GC might have run before we sent the request, leaving dom0 idle and wasting the time.
Keeping multiple requests in flight would eliminate this risk.</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<p>I originally wrote the viewer as a native GTK application in OCaml.
The browser version was created by running the magical <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/">js_of_ocaml</a> tool, which turned out to be incredibly easy.
I just had to add support for the HTML canvas API alongside the code for GTK&#8217;s Cairo canvas, but they&#8217;re almost the same anyway.
Now my embarrassing inability to learn JavaScript need not hold me back!</p>

<p>Finding a layout algorithm that produced sensible results was the hardest part.
I&#8217;m quite pleased with the result.
The basic algorithm is:</p>

<ul>  <li>Generate an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree">interval tree</a> of the thread lifetimes.</li>
  <li>Starting with the root thread, place each thread at the highest place on the screen where it doesn&#8217;t overlap any other threads, and no higher than its parent.</li>
  <li>Visit the threads recursively, depth first, visiting the child threads created in <em>reverse</em> order.</li>
  <li>If one thread merges with another, allow them to overlap.</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t show bind-type threads as children of their actual creator, but instead delay their start time to when they get activated and make them children of the thread that activates them, <em>unless</em> their parent merges with them.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the vertical layout I originally used scrolling, but it was hard to navigate.
It now transforms the vertical coordinates from the layout engine by passing them through the <code>tanh</code> function, allowing you to focus on a particular thread but still see all the others, just more bunched up.
The main difficulty here is focusing on one of the top or bottom threads without wasting half the display area, which complicated the code a bit.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Understanding concurrent programs can be much easier with a good visualisation.
By instrumenting Lwt, it was quite easy to collect useful information about what threads were doing.
Libraries that use Lwt only needed to be modified in order to label the threads.</p>

<p>My particular interest in making these tools is to explore the behaviour of <a href="http://openmirage.org/">Mirage unikernels</a> - tiny virtual machines written in OCaml that run without the overhead of traditional operating systems.</p>

<p>The traces produced provide much more information than the graphs I made previously.
We can see now not just when the unikernel isn&#8217;t making progress, but why.
We saw that the networking code spends a lot of time handling ack messages from dom0 saying that it has read the data we shared with it, and that the disk code was splitting requests into small chunks because it didn&#8217;t support indirect requests.</p>

<p>There is plenty of scope for improvement in the tools - some things I&#8217;d like include:</p>

<ul>  <li>A way to group or hide threads if you want to focus on something else, as diagrams can become very cluttered with e.g. threads waiting for shared pages to be released.</li>
  <li>The ability to stitch together traces from multiple machines so you can e.g. follow the progress of an IP packet after it leaves the VM.</li>
  <li>A visual indication of when interrupts occur vs when Mirage gets around to servicing them.</li>
  <li>More stats collection and reporting (e.g. average response time to handle a TCP request, etc).</li>
  <li>A more compact log format and more efficient tracing.</li>
</ul>

<p>But hopefully, these tools will already help people to learn more about how their unikernels behave.
If you&#8217;re interested in tracing or unikernels, the <a href="http://openmirage.org/community/">Mirage mailing list</a> is a good place to discuss things.</p>

<p>Here, the solver selected SAM version 0.16, along with its dependencies. GraphViz 2.38.0 and OpenJDK-JRE 7.65 are already installed from my distribution repository, while SWT 3.6.1 and IRIS 0.6.0 need to be downloaded (e.g. using <code>0install download</code>).</p>

<p>This post is about the code that decides which versions to use, and my attempts to make it easier to understand using OCaml functors and abstraction.
For a gentle introduction to functors, see <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/functors.html">Real World OCaml: Chapter 9. Functors</a>.</p>

<h3>How dependency solvers work</h3>

<p>( This section isn&#8217;t about functors, but it&#8217;s quite interesting background. You can skip it if you prefer. )</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say I want to run <code>foo</code>, a graphical Java application.
There are three versions available:</p>

<ul>  <li><code>foo1</code> (stable)
    <ul>      <li>requires Java 6..!7 (at least version 6, but before version 7)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>foo2</code> (stable)
    <ul>      <li>requires Java 6.. (at least version 6)</li>
      <li>requires SWT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>foo3</code> (testing)
    <ul>      <li>requires Java 7..</li>
      <li>requires SWT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#8217;s imagine we have some candidates for Java and SWT too:</p>

<ul>  <li>Java: <code>java6_32bit</code>, <code>java6_64bit</code>, <code>java7_64bit</code>, <code>java8_64bit</code></li>
  <li>SWT: <code>swt35_32bit</code>, <code>swt35_64bit</code>, <code>swt36_32bit</code>, <code>swt36_64bit</code></li>
</ul>

<p>My computer can run 32- and 64-bit binaries, so we need to consider both.</p>

<p>We start by generating a set of boolean constraints defining the necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of valid selections.
Each candidate becomes one variable, with <code>true</code> meaning it will be used and <code>false</code> that it won&#8217;t (following the approach in <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/papers/opium.html">OPIUM</a>).
For example, we don&#8217;t want to select more than one version of each component, so the following must all be true:</p>

<p>Once we have all the equations, we throw them at a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT</a> solver to get a set of valid versions.
0install&#8217;s SAT solver is based on the <a href="http://minisat.se/Papers.html">MiniSat</a> algorithm.
The basic algorithm, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm">DPLL</a>, works like this:</p>

<ol>  <li>The SAT solver simplifies the problem by looking for clauses with only a single variable.
If it finds any, it knows the value of that variable and can simplify the other clauses.</li>
  <li>When no further simplification is possible, it asks its caller to pick a variable to try.
Here, we might try <code>foo2=true</code>, for example.
It then goes back to step 1 to simplify again and so on, until it has either a solution or a conflict.
If a variable assignment leads to a conflict, then we go back and try it the other way (e.g. <code>foo2=false</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>In the above example, the process would be:</p>

<ol>  <li>No initial simplification is possible.</li>
  <li>Try <code>foo2=true</code>.</li>
  <li>This immediately leads to <code>foo1=false</code> and <code>foo3=false</code>.</li>
  <li>Now we try <code>java8_64bit=true</code>.</li>
  <li>This immediately removes the other versions of Java from consideration.</li>
  <li>It also immediately leads to <code>x64=true</code>, which eliminates all the 32-bit binaries.</li>
  <li>It also eliminates all versions of SWT.</li>
  <li><code>foo2</code> depends on SWT, so eliminating all versions leads to <code>foo2=false</code>, which is a conflict because we already set it to <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>MiniSat, unlike basic DPLL, doesn&#8217;t just backtrack when it gets a conflict.
It also works backwards from the conflicting clause to find a small set of variables that are sufficient to cause the conflict.
In this case, we find that <code>foo2 and java8_64bit</code> implies conflict.
To avoid the conflict, we must make sure that at least one of these is false, and we can do this by adding a new clause:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="ow">not</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="ow">not</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">java8_64bit</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>In this example, this has the same effect as simple backtracking, but if we&#8217;d chosen other variables between these two then learning the general rule could save us from exploring many other dead-ends.
We now try with <code>java7_64bit=true</code> and then <code>swt36_64bit=true</code>, which leads to a solution.</p>

<h3>Optimising the result</h3>

<p>The above process will always find some valid solution if one exists, but we generally want an &#8220;optimal&#8221; solution (e.g. preferring newer versions).
There are several ways to do this.</p>

<p>In his talk at <a href="https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/#Program">OCaml 2014</a>, <em>Using Preferences to Tame your Package Manager</em>, Roberto Di Cosmo explained how their tools allow you to specify a function to be optimised (e.g. <code>-count(removed),-count(changed)</code> to minimise the number of packages to be removed or changed).
When you have a global set of package versions (as in OPAM, Debian, etc) this is very useful, because the package manager needs to find solution that balances the needs of all installed programs.</p>

<p>0install has an interesting advantage here.
We can install multiple versions of libraries in parallel, and we don&#8217;t allow one program to influence another program&#8217;s choices.
If we run another SWT application, <code>bar</code>, we&#8217;ll probably pick the same SWT version (<code>bar</code> will probably also prefer the latest stable 64-bit version) and so <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> will share the copy.
But if we run a non-SWT Java application, we are free to pick a better version of Java (e.g. Java 8) just for that program.</p>

<p>This means that we don&#8217;t need to find a compromise solution for multiple programs.
When running <code>foo</code>, the version of <code>foo</code> itself is far more important than the versions of the libraries it uses.
We therefore define the &#8220;optimal&#8221; solution as the one optimising first the version of the main program, then the version of its first dependency and so on.
This means that:</p>

<ul>  <li>The behaviour is predictable and easy to explain.</li>
  <li>The behaviour is stable (small changes to libraries deep in the tree have little effect).</li>
  <li>Programs can rank their dependencies by importance, because earlier dependencies are optimised first.</li>
  <li>If <code>foo2</code> is the best version for our policy (e.g. &#8220;prefer latest stable version&#8221;) then every solution with <code>foo2=true</code> is better than every solution without.
If we direct the solver to try <code>foo2=true</code> and get a solution, there&#8217;s no point considering the <code>foo2=false</code> cases.
This means that the first solution we find will always be optimal, which is very fast!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The current solver code</h2>

<p>The existing code is made up of several components:</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper border center"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/solver/components.png" title='Arrows indicate "uses" relationship.' width="" /><span class="caption-text">Arrows indicate &#8220;uses&#8221; relationship.</span></span></p>

<dl>  <dt>SAT Solver</dt>
  <dd>Implements the SAT solver itself (if you want to use this code in your own projects, Simon Cruanes has
made a standalone version at <a href="https://github.com/c-cube/sat">https://github.com/c-cube/sat</a>, which has some additional features and
optimisations).</dd>
  <dt>Solver</dt>
  <dd>Fetches the candidate versions for each interface URI (equivalent to the package name in other systems) and builds up the SAT problem, then uses the SAT solver to solve it.
It directs the SAT solver in the direction of the optimal solution when there is a choice, as explained above.</dd>
  <dt>Impl provider</dt>
  <dd>Takes an interface URI and provides the candidates (&#8220;implementations&#8221;) to the solver.
The candidates can come from multiple XML &#8220;feed&#8221; files: the one at the given URI itself, plus any extra feeds that one imports, plus any additional local or remote feeds the user has added (e.g. a version in a local Git checkout or which has been built from source locally).
The impl provider also filters out obviously impossible choices (e.g. Windows binaries if we&#8217;re on Linux, uncached versions in off-line mode, etc) and then ranks the remaining candidates according to the local policy (e.g. preferring stable versions, higher version numbers, etc).</dd>
  <dt>Feed provider</dt>
  <dd>Simply loads the feed XML from the disk cache or local file, if available.
It does not access the network.</dd>
  <dt>Driver</dt>
  <dd>Uses the solver to get an initial solution.
Then it asks the feed provider which feeds the solver tried to access and starts downloading them.
As new feeds arrive, it runs the solver again, possibly starting more downloads.
Managing these downloads is quite interesting; I used it as the example in <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/11/28/asynchronous-python-vs-ocaml/">Asynchronous Python vs OCaml</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This is reasonably well split up already, thanks to occasional refactoring efforts, but we can always do better.
The subject of today&#8217;s refactoring is the solver module itself.</p>

<p>What does <code>do_solve</code> actually do?
It gets candidates (of type <code>Impl.generic_implementation</code>) from <code>Impl_provider</code> and produces a <code>Selections.t</code>.
<code>Impl.generic_implementation</code> is a complex type including, among other things, the raw XML <code>&lt;implementation&gt;</code> element from the feed XML.
A <code>Selections.t</code> is a set of <code>&lt;selection&gt;</code> XML elements.</p>

<p>In other words: <code>do_solve</code> takes some arbitrary XML and produces some other XML.
It&#8217;s very hard to tell from the <code>solver.mli</code> interface file what features of the input data it uses in the solve, and which it simply passes through.</p>

<p>Now imagine that instead of working on these messy concrete types, the solver instead used only a module with this type:</p>

<p>We could then see exactly what information the solver needed to do its job.
For example, we could see just from the type signature that the solver doesn&#8217;t understand version numbers, but just uses <code>meets_restriction</code> to check whether an abstract implementation (candidate) meets an abstract restriction.</p>

<p>Using OCaml&#8217;s functors we can do just this, splitting out the core (non-XML) parts of the solver into a <code>Solver_core</code> module with a signature something like:</p>

<p>This says that, given <em>any</em> concrete module that matches the <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> type, the <code>Make</code> functor will return a module with a suitable <code>do_solve</code> function.
In particular, the compiler will check that the solver core makes no further assumptions about the types.
If it assumes that a <code>Model.impl_provider</code> is any particular concrete type then <code>solver_core.ml</code> will fail to compile, for example.</p>

<h2>Discovering the interface</h2>

<p>The above sounds nice in theory, but how easy is it to change the existing code to the new design?
I don&#8217;t even know what <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> will actually look like - surely more complex than the example above!
Actually, it turned out to be quite easy.
You can start with just a few concrete types, e.g.</p>

<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t constrain <code>Solver_core</code> at all, since it&#8217;s allowed to know the real types and use them as before.
This step just lets us make the <code>Solver_core.Make</code> functor and have things still compile and work.</p>

<p>Next, I made <code>impl_provider</code> abstract (removing the <code>= Impl_provider.impl_provider</code>), letting the compiler find all the places where the code assumed the concrete type.</p>

<p>First, it was getting the candidate implementations for an interface from it.
The <code>impl_provider</code> was actually returning several things: the valid candidates, the rejects, and an optional conflicting interface (used when one interface replaces another).
The solver doesn&#8217;t use the rejects, which are only needed for the diagnostics system, so we can simplify that interface here.</p>

<p>Secondly, not all dependencies need to be considered (e.g. a Windows-only dependency when we&#8217;re on Linux).
Since the <code>impl_provider</code> already knows the platform in order to filter out incompatible binaries, we also use it to filter the dependencies.
Our new module type is:</p>

<p>At this point, I&#8217;m not trying to improve the interface, just to find out what it is.
Continuing to make the types abstract in this way is a fairly mechanical process, which led to:</p>

<p>The main addition is the <code>command</code> type, which is essentially an optional entry point to an implementation.
For example, if a library can also be used as a program then it may provide a &#8220;run&#8221; command, perhaps adding a dependency on an option parser library.
Programs often also provide a &#8220;test&#8221; command for running the unit-tests, etc.
There are also two <code>to_string</code> functions at the end for debugging and diagnostics.</p>

<p>Having elicited this API between the solver and the rest of the system, it was clear that it had a few flaws:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p><code>is_dep_needed</code> is pointless. There are only two places where we pass a dependency to the solver (<code>requires</code> and <code>command_requires</code>), so we can just filter the unnecessary dependencies out there and not bother the solver core with them at all.
The abstraction ensures there&#8217;s no other way for the solver core to get a dependency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><code>impl_self_commands</code> and <code>command_self_commands</code> worried me.
These are used for the (rare) case that one command in an implementation depends on another command in the same implementation.
This might happen if, for example, the &#8220;test&#8221; command wants to test the &#8220;run&#8221; command.
Logically, these are just another kind of dependency; returning them separately means code that follows dependencies might forget them.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, there was just such a bug in the code.
When we build the SAT problem we <em>do</em> consider self commands (so we always find a valid result), but when we&#8217;re optimising the result we ignore them, possibly leading to non-optimal solutions.
I added a unit-test and made <code>requires</code> return both dependencies and self commands together to avoid the same mistake in future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>For a similar reason, I replaced <code>dep_iface</code>, <code>dep_required_commands</code>, <code>restricts_only</code> and <code>dep_essential</code> with a single <code>dep_info</code> function returning a record type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>I added <code>type command_name = private string</code>.
This means that the solver can&#8217;t confuse command names with other strings and makes the type signature more obvious.
I didn&#8217;t make it fully abstract, but was a bit lazy and used <code>private</code>, allowing the solver to cast to a string for debug logging and to let it use them as keys in a StringMap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>There is a boolean <code>source</code> attribute in <code>do_solve</code> and <code>implementations</code>.
This is used if the user wants to select source code rather than a binary.
I wanted to support the case of a compiler that is compiled using an older version of itself (though I never completed this work).
In that case, we need to select different versions of the same interface, so the solver actually picks a unique implementation for each (interface, source) pair.</p>

    <p>I tried giving these pairs a new abstract type - &#8220;role&#8221; - and that simplified things nicely.
It turned out that every place where we passed only an interface (e.g. <code>dep_iface</code>), we eventually ended up doing <code>(iface, false)</code> to get back to a role, so I was able to replace these with roles too.</p>

    <p>This is quite significant.
Currently, the main interface can be source or binary but dependencies are always binary.
For example, source code may depend on a compiler, build tool, etc.
People have wondered in the past how easy it would be to support dependencies on source code too - it turns out this now requires no changes to the solver, just an extra attribute in the XML format!</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>With the role type now abstract, I removed <code>Model.t</code> (the <code>impl_provider</code>) and moved it inside the role type.
This simplifies the API and allows us to use different providers for different roles (imagine solving for components to cross-compile a program; some dependencies like <code>make</code> should be for the build platform, while others are for the target).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <code>Role</code> is a submodule to make it easy to use it as the key in a map.</p>

<p>Hopefully you find it much easier to understand what the solver does (and doesn&#8217;t) do from this type.
The <code>Solver_core</code> code no longer depends on the rest of 0install and can be understood on its own.</p>

<p>The remaining code in <code>Solver</code> defines the implementation of a <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> module and applies the functor, like this:</p>

<p>The <code>CoreModel</code> implementation of <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> simply maps the abstract types and functions to use the real types.
The limitation that dependencies are always binary is easier to see here, and it&#8217;s fairly obvious how to fix it.</p>

<p>Note that we <em>don&#8217;t</em> define the module as <code>module CoreModel : SOLVER_INPUT = ...</code>.
The rest of the code in <code>Solver</code> still needs to see the concrete types; only <code>Solver_core</code> is restricted to see it just as a <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code>.</p>

<h2>Comparison with Java</h2>

<p>Using functors for this seemed pretty easy, and I started wondering how I&#8217;d solve this problem in other languages.
Python simply can&#8217;t do this kind of thing, of course - there you have to read all the code to understand what it does.
In Java, we might declare some abstract interfaces, though:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a problem, though.
We can create a <code>ConcreteRole</code> and pass that to <code>Solver.do_solve</code>, but we&#8217;ll get back a map from abstract roles to abstract impls.
We need to get concrete types out to do anything useful with the result.</p>

<p>A Java programmer would probably cast the results back to the concrete types, but there&#8217;s a problem with this (beyond the obvious fact that it&#8217;s not statically type checked):
If we accept dynamic casting as a legitimate technique (OCaml doesn&#8217;t support it), there&#8217;s nothing to stop the abstract solver core from doing it too.
We&#8217;re back to reading all the code to find out what information it really uses.</p>

<p>There are other places where dynamic casts are needed too, such as in <code>meets_restriction</code> (which needs a concrete implementation, not an abstract one).</p>

<p>I did try using generics, but I didn&#8217;t manage to get it to compile, and I stopped when I got to:</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s fair to say that if this ever did compile, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t have made the code easier to read.</p>

<h2>Diagnostics</h2>

<p>The <code>Diagnostics</code> module takes a failed solver result (produced with <code>do_solve ~closest_match:true</code>) that is close to what we think the user wanted but with some components left blank, and tries to explain to the user why none of the available candidates was suitable
(see the <a href="http://0install.net/injector-trouble.html">Trouble-shooting</a> guide for some examples and pictures).</p>

<p>I made a <code>SOLVER_RESULT</code> module type which extended <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> with the final selections and diagnostic information:</p>

<p>Note: the <code>explain</code> function here is for the diagnostics-of-last-resort; the diagnostics system uses it on cases it can&#8217;t explain itself, which generally indicates a bug somewhere.</p>

<p>Then I made a <code>Diagnostics.Make</code> functor as with <code>Solver_core</code>.
This means that the diagnostics now sees the same information as the solver, with the above additions.
For example, it sees the same dependencies as the solver did (e.g. we can&#8217;t forget to filter them out with <code>is_dep_needed</code>).
Like the solver, the diagnostics assumed that a dependency was always a binary dependency and used <code>(iface, false)</code> to get the role.
Since the role is now abstract, it can&#8217;t do this and should cope with source dependencies automatically.</p>

<p>The new API prompted me to consider self-command dependencies again, so the diagnostics code is now able to explain correctly problems caused by missing self-commands (previously, I forgot to handle this case).</p>

<h2>Selections</h2>

<p>Sometimes we use the results of the solver directly.
In other cases, we save them to disk as an <a href="http://0install.net/selections-spec.html">XML selections document</a> first.
These XML documents are handled by the <code>Selections</code> module, which had its own API.</p>

<p>For consistency, I decided to share type names and methods as much as possible.
I split out the core of <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> into another module type:</p>

<p>Actually, there is some overlap with <code>SOLVER_RESULT</code> too, so I created a <code>SELECTIONS</code> type as well:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/solver/sigs.png" /></p>

<p>Now the relationship becomes clear.
<code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> extends the core model with ways to get the possible candidates and restrictions on their use.
<code>SELECTIONS</code> extends the core with ways to find out which implementations were selected.
<code>SOLVER_RESULT</code> combines the above two, providing extra information for diagnostics by relating the selections back to the candidates (information that isn&#8217;t available when loading saved selections).</p>

<p>I had a bit of trouble here.
I wanted to include <code>CORE_MODEL</code> in <code>SELECTIONS</code>, but doing that caused an error when I tried to bring them together in <code>SOLVER_RESULT</code>,
because of the duplicate <code>Role</code> submodule.
So instead I just define the types I need and let the user of the signature link them up.</p>

<p>Update: I&#8217;ve since discovered that you can just do <code>with module Role := Role</code> to solve this.</p>

<p>Correct use of the <code>with</code> keyword seems the key to a happy life with OCaml functors.
When defining the <code>RoleMap</code> submodule in <code>SELECTIONS</code> I use it to let users know the keys of a <code>RoleMap</code> are the same type as <code>SELECTIONS.role</code> (otherwise it will be abstract and you can&#8217;t assume anything about it).
In <code>SOLVER_RESULT</code>, I use it to link the types in <code>SELECTIONS</code> with the types in <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code>.</p>

<p>Notice the use of <code>=</code> vs <code>:=</code>.
<code>=</code> says that two types are the same.
<code>:=</code> additionally removes the type from the module signature.
We use <code>:=</code> for <code>impl</code> because we already have a type with that name from <code>SOLVER_INPUT</code> and we can&#8217;t have two.
However, we use <code>=</code> for <code>role</code> because that doesn&#8217;t exist in <code>CORE_MODEL</code> and we&#8217;d like <code>SOLVER_RESULT</code> to include everything in <code>SELECTIONS</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I included the new <code>SELECTIONS</code> signature in the interface file for the <code>Selections</code> module:</p>

<p>With this change, anything that uses <code>SELECTIONS</code> can work with both loaded selections and with the solver output, even though they have different implementations.
For example, the <code>Tree</code> module generates a tree (for display) from a selections dependency graph (pruning loops and diamonds).
It&#8217;s now a functor, which can be used with either.
For example, <code>0install show selections.xml</code> applies it to the <code>Selections</code> module:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The same code is used in the GUI to render the tree view, but now with <code>Make(Solver.Model)</code>.
As before, it&#8217;s important to preserve the types - the GUI needs to know that each node in the tree is a <code>Solver.Model.Role.t</code> so that it can show information about the available candidates, for example.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>An important function of a package manager is finding a set of package versions that are compatible.
An efficient way to do this is to express the necessary and sufficient constraints as a set of boolean equations and then use a SAT solver to find a solution.
While finding a valid solution is easy, finding the optimal one can be harder.
Because 0install is able to install libraries in parallel and can choose to use different versions for different applications, it only needs to consider one application at a time.
As well as being faster, this makes it possible to use a simple definition of optimality that is easy to compute.</p>

<p>0install&#8217;s existing solver code has already been broken down into modular components: downloading metadata, collecting candidates, rejecting invalid candidates and ranking the rest, building the SAT problem and solving it.
However, the code that builds the SAT problem and optimises the solution was tightly coupled to the concrete representation, making it harder to see what it was doing and harder to extend it with new features.
Its type signature essentially just said that it takes XML as input and returns XML as output.</p>

<p>OCaml functors are functions over modules.
They allow a module to declare the interface it expects from its dependencies in an abstract way, providing just the information the module requires and nothing else.
The module can then be compiled against this abstract interface, ensuring that it makes no assumptions about the actual types.
Later, the functor can be applied to the concrete representation to get a module that uses the concrete types.</p>

<p>Turning the existing solver code into a functor turned out to be a simple iterative process that discovered the existing implicit API between the solver and the rest of the code.
Once this abstract API had been found, many possible improvements became obvious.
The new solver core is both simpler than the original and can be understood on its own without looking at the rest of the code.
It is also more flexible: we could now add support for source dependencies, cross-compilation, etc, without changing the core of the solver.
The challenge now is only how to express these things in the XML format.</p>

<p>In a language without functors, such as Java, we could still define the solver to work over abstract interfaces, but the results returned would also be abstract, which is not useful.
Trying to achieve the same effect as functors using generics appears very difficult and the resulting code would likely be hard to read.</p>

<p>Splitting up the abstract interface into multiple module types allowed parts of the interface to be shared with the separate selections-handling module.
This in turn allowed another module - for turning selections into trees - to become a functor that could also work directly on the solver results.
Finally, it made the relationship between the solver results and the selections type clear - solver results are selections plus diagnostics information.</p>

<h2>The TCP test-case</h2>

<p><code>Profile.time</code> just runs the function and returns how long it took in seconds.
I do a few warm-up iterations at the start because TCP starts slowly and we don&#8217;t want to benchmark that.</p>

<h2>Compiler optimisations</h2>

<p>While looking at the assembler output during some earlier debugging, I&#8217;d noticed that gcc was generating very poor code. For example:</p>

<pre><code>0041a550 &lt;_xmalloc&gt;:
  41a550:	e92d4800 	push	{fp, lr}
  41a554:	e28db004 	add	fp, sp, #4
  41a558:	e24dd028 	sub	sp, sp, #40	; 0x28
  41a55c:	e50b0028 	str	r0, [fp, #-40]	; 0x28
  41a560:	e50b102c 	str	r1, [fp, #-44]	; 0x2c
  41a564:	e3a03000 	mov	r3, #0
  41a568:	e50b300c 	str	r3, [fp, #-12]
  41a56c:	e3a03010 	mov	r3, #16
  41a570:	e50b3014 	str	r3, [fp, #-20]
  41a574:	e51b002c 	ldr	r0, [fp, #-44]	; 0x2c
  41a578:	e3a01004 	mov	r1, #4
  41a57c:	ebffff5d 	bl	41a2f8 &lt;align_up&gt;
  41a580:	e50b002c 	str	r0, [fp, #-44]	; 0x2c
  41a584:	e51b002c 	ldr	r0, [fp, #-44]	; 0x2c
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>gcc is using registers very inefficiently here.
For example, it stores <code>r1</code> to <code>[fp, #-44]</code> and then a few lines later loads from there into <code>r0</code>, when it could just have moved it directly.
The last two lines show it saving <code>r0</code> to the stack and then immediately loading it back again into the same register!</p>

<p>The fix here turned out to be simple.
Mini-OS by default compiles in debug mode with no optimisations.
Compiling with <code>debug=n</code> fixes this, and I <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios/pull/4">updated mirage-xen-minios</a> to do this.</p>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th>Optimisations</th>
      <th>TCP download speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>none</td>
      <td>6.92 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>-O3</td>
      <td>11.93 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Even though Mirage is almost all OCaml, it does use Mini-OS&#8217;s C functions for various low-level operations and these optimisations make a big difference!</p>

<h2>Profiling support</h2>

<p>The OCaml compiler provides a profiling option, which works the same way as gcc&#8217;s <code>-pg</code> option for C code.
To enable it, you add <code>true: profile</code> to your <code>_tags</code> file and rebuild.</p>

<p>I decided to see what would happen if I enabled this for my Xen unikernel:</p>

<pre><code>_build/main.native.o: In function `caml_program':
:(.text+0x2): undefined reference to `__gnu_mcount_nc'
</code></pre>

<p>Profiling works by inserting a call to <code>__gnu_mcount_nc</code> at the start of every function.
It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>00000000 &lt;caml_program&gt;:
   0:       b500            push    {lr}
   2:       f7ff fffe       bl      0 &lt;__gnu_mcount_nc&gt;
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>__gnu_mcount_nc</code> function gets the address of the callee function (<code>caml_program</code> in this example) in the link register (<code>lr</code>/<code>r14</code>) and the address of its caller on the stack (pushed by the code fragment above).
Normally, the profiler would use this information to build up a static call graph (saying which functions call which other functions).
Using a regular timer interrupt to sample the program counter it can estimate how much time was spent in each function,
and using the call graph it can show cumulative totals (time spent in each function plus time spent in its children).</p>

<p>I decided to start with something a bit simpler.
I wrote <a href="https://github.com/talex5/xen/blob/8f786348db50611e1251dc3ed505bdf5bb388fe9/extras/mini-os/arch/arm/arm32.S#L330">some ARM code</a> for <code>__gnu_mcount_nc</code> that simply writes the caller, callee and current time to a trace buffer (when the buffer is full, it stops tracing).
Ideally, I&#8217;d like to get notified each time we leave a function too.
gcc can do that for C code with its <code>-finstrument-functions</code> option, but I didn&#8217;t see an option for that in OCaml.
Instead, I assume that every function runs until I see a call whose caller is not its parent.
This works surprisingly well, though it does mean that if a function seems to take a long time you need to check its parents too,
and it might get confused for recursive calls.
Also, for tail calls, we see the parent as the function we will return to rather than the function that actually called us.</p>

<p>At the end, I dump out the trace buffer to the console with some OCaml code.
Back on my laptop, I wrote some code to parse this output and look up each address in the ELF image to get the function name for each address.
(This code isn&#8217;t public yet as it needs a lot of cleaning up.)</p>

<p>One thing I quickly discovered: compiling just the unikernel with profiling isn&#8217;t sufficient.
As soon as you call a non-profiled function it can no longer construct the call graph and the results are useless.
I manually recompiled every C and OCaml library I was using with profiling, which was quite tedious.</p>

<p>Update: Thomas Gazagnaire has added an <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/2479">OPAM profiling switch</a> which should make this much easier in future.</p>

<p>Initially, the trace buffer filled up almost instantly with calls to <code>stub_evtchn_test_and_clear</code>.
It seems that we call this once for each of the 4096 channels every time we look for work.
To avoid clutter, I reduced the number of event channels to 10 (this had no noticeable effect on performance).
I also tried removing the <code>memset</code> which zeroes out newly allocated IO pages.
This also made no difference.</p>

<p>I measured the overhead added by the tracing, both when compiled in but inactive and when actively writing to the trace buffer:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/tracing-overhead.png" /></p>

<p>So, not too bad.</p>

<h2>Profiling the console</h2>

<p>The TCP code&#8217;s trace was quite complicated, so I decided to start by profiling the much simpler console device,
which I&#8217;d noticed was surprisingly slow at dumping the trace results.</p>

<p>A Xen virtual console is a pair of ring buffers (one for input from the keyboard, one for output to the screen) in a shared memory page, defined like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>console.h </span></figcaption>

</span><span class="line"><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We&#8217;re only interested in the &#8220;out&#8221; side here.
The producer (i.e. our unikernel) writes the data to the buffer and advances the <code>out_prod</code> counter.
The consumer (<code>xenconsoled</code>, running in Dom0) reads the data and advances <code>out_cons</code>.
If the consumer catches up with the producer it sleeps until the producer notifies it there is more data.
If the producer catches up with the consumer (the buffer is full) it sleeps until the consumer notifies it there is space available again.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my console test-case - writing a string to the console in a loop:</p>

<p>The start time and duration are measured in counter clock ticks, and the counter is running at 24 MHz.
The <code>--&gt;--&gt;--&gt;</code> indicates the level of nesting (I vary the character to make it easier to scan vertically with the eye).
The output shows two iterations of the loop taken from the middle of the sample.
To make the output more readable, my analysis script prunes the tree at calls that took less than 50 ticks, and removes calls to the Lwt library (while still showing the functions they called as a result).
The durations include the times for their children (including pruned children).</p>

<p>You can see that on each iteration we call <code>Console.write_all_low</code>, which writes the string to the shared memory ring and notifies the console daemon in Dom0.
Each iteration is taking roughly 200 ticks, which is about 8 us per iteration.
So we&#8217;d expect the speed to be around 6 bytes / 8 us, which is about 700 KB/s.</p>

<p>Looking at the cumulative time spent in each function, the top entries are:</p>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Ticks (at 24 MHz)</th>

      <td>298735</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note: the trace only includes calls until the trace buffer was full, so these aren&#8217;t the total times for the whole run.
But we can immediately see that we spent most of the time in <code>block_domain</code>, which is what Mirage calls when it has nothing to do and is waiting for an external event.
Here&#8217;s a graph showing how many iterations of the test loop we had started over time:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/xen-console-messages.png" /></p>

<p>So, we wrote 679 messages very quickly, then waited a long time, then wrote 1027 more, then waited again, etc.
I thought there might be a bug in <code>block_domain</code> causing it to miss a wake-up event, so I limited the time it would spend blocking.
It didn&#8217;t make any difference; it would keep waking up, seeing that it had nothing to do, and going back to sleep again.</p>

<p>In case the problem was with Mirage&#8217;s implementation of the shared rings or console device,
I tried writing the same test directly in C in Mini-OS&#8217;s <code>test.c</code> and got the same result (I had to modify it slightly because by default Mini-OS&#8217;s <code>console_print</code> discards data when the buffer is full instead of waiting).
Finally, I tried it from a Linux guest and got 25 KB/s (interestingly, Linux uses 100% CPU while doing this).
The times were highly variable (each point on this plot is from writing the message 10,000 times and calculating the average):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/xen-console-speed.png" /></p>

<p>After some investigation, it turned out that Xen was deliberately limiting the rate:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>xen/tools/console/daemon/io.c </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="c"><span class="line"><span class="cm">/* How many events are allowed in each time period */</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="cp">#define RATE_LIMIT_ALLOWANCE 30</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="cm">/* Duration of each time period in ms */</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="cp">#define RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD 200</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Mystery solved, although I don&#8217;t know why the rates are so variable.
Mirage wasn&#8217;t doing anything except running the test case and Linux was booted with <code>init=/bin/bash</code>, so there was nothing else running there either.</p>

<p>Lessons:</p>

<ul>  <li>Just scrolling through the raw trace can be misleading. It appears that it keeps calling the loop function, but in fact almost all the time was spent in the two very rare <code>block_domain</code> calls. Graphing iterations over time can show these problems effectively.</li>
  <li>Compare with the speed on Linux. Sometimes, Xen really is that slow and it&#8217;s not our fault.</li>
  <li>Compile everything for profiling or the results aren&#8217;t much use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Profiling UDP</h2>

<p>TCP involves ack packets, expanding windows and other complications, so I next looked at the simpler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> protocol.
Here, we can throw packets out continuously without worrying about the other end.</p>

<p>With a payload size of 1476 bytes (the maximum possible for UDP), I got 17 MB/s.
All packets were successfully received on my laptop.
My Linux guest got 13.4 MB/s with <code>nc -u &lt; /dev/zero</code>, so we&#8217;re actually faster!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a sample iteration from the trace:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a graph of loop iterations (packets sent) over time (each blue dot is one packet sent):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/udp-packets.png" /></p>

<p>The gaps indicate places where we were not sending packets.
The garbage collector shows up twice in the trace (both times in <code>Ring.ack_responses</code> oddly).
However, we spend more time in <code>block_domain</code> than doing GC, indicating that we&#8217;re often waiting for Xen.
Looking at the trace just before it blocks, I see calls to <code>Netif.wait_for_free_tx</code>, which seems reasonable.</p>

<h2>Profiling TCP</h2>

<p>The TCP header is larger than the UDP one, making it less efficient even in the best case,
and TCP needs to process acks, keep track of window sizes, and handle retransmissions.
Strange, then, that the Linux guest manages 39 MB/s over TCP compared with just 13.4 MB/s for UDP!
(even stranger is that I got 47.2 MB/s for Linux when I tried it for last
month&#8217;s post; however I am using a different version of Linux in dom0 now)</p>

<p>I capture some packets sent by the Linux guest using <code>tshark</code> running in Dom0.
Loading it into Wireshark on my laptop, I see that all the TCP checksums are wrong, so it
looks like Linux is using TCP checksum offloading.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-12/msg00884.html">Question about TCP checksum offload in Xen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>  <p>A domain has no way of knowing how any given packet is going to leave the host (or even if it is) so it can&#8217;t know ahead of time whether to calculate any checksums: the skb&#8217;s [socket buffers] are just marked with &#8220;checksum needed&#8221; as usual and either the egress NIC will do the job or dom0 will do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting this working on Mirage was a bit tricky.
The TCP layer can avoid adding the checksum only if the network device says it&#8217;s capable of doing it itself, and packets have to be flagged as needing the checksum.
You can&#8217;t just flag all packets because the Linux dom0 silently drops non-TCP/UDP packets with it set (e.g. ARP packets).
I hacked something together and got a modest speed improvement.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a graph for the TCP test, where each iteration of the loop is sending one TCP packet (segment):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/tcp-packets.png" /></p>

<p>Note: we send many warm up packets before starting the trace as TCP starts slowly (which looks pretty but isn&#8217;t relevant here).</p>

<p>Zooming in, the picture is quite interesting (where it had gaps, I searched for a typical function that occurred in the gap and added a symbol for it):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/tcp-packets-zoom.png" /></p>

<p>It looks like we start by transmitting packets steadily, until the current window is full.
Then we start buffering the packets instead of sending them, which is very fast.
At some point the TCP system stops accepting more data, which causes the main loop to block, allowing us to process other events.
<code>rx_poll response</code> indicates one iteration of the <code>Netif.rx_poll</code> loop, which seems to be dealing with acks from Xen saying that our packets have been transmitted (and the memory can therefore be recycled).
After a while, the TCP ack packets arrive and we process them, which opens up the transmit window again.
Then we send out the buffered packets, before returning to the main loop.</p>

<p>So, in each cycle we spend about 60% of the time transmitting packets, a quarter dealing with acks from Xen and the rest handling TCP acks from the remote host.
It might be possible to optimise things a bit here by reusing grant references, but I didn&#8217;t investigate further.</p>

<h2>Profiling disk access</h2>

<p>My next test case reads a series of sectors sequentially from the disk and then writes them. Reading or writing one sector (4096 bytes) at a time was very slow (2.7 MB/s read, 0.7 MB/s write).
Using larger buffers, so that we transfer more in each operation, helped but even at 64 sectors per op I only got 12.3 MB/s read / 5.12 MB/s write (the device is capable of 20 MB/s read and 10 MB/s write).
Here&#8217;s a trace where we read using 32-sector buffers (10.9 MB/s):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/block-reads-1-32.png" /></p>

<p>We spend a lot of time waiting for each block to arrive, although there are some curious ack messages, which we deal with quickly.
What if we have two requests in flight at once?
This gets us 18.27 MB/s:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/block-reads-2-32.png" /></p>

<p>Strangely, the two blocks arrive close together.
Although it takes us longer to get the first one (I don&#8217;t know why), we get them more quickly after that.
Having three requests in flight doesn&#8217;t help though (18.25 MB/s):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/block-reads-3-32.png" /></p>

<p>Looking at the block driver code, it batches requests into groups of 11. This probably explains why 32 sectors-per-read did well - it&#8217;s very close to 33.</p>

<p>For writing, the number of requests in flight makes little difference, but writing 8 sectors in each request is by far the best (7 MB/s).</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;re not getting the full speed of the card here, since we&#8217;re spending most of the time blocking.
However, we are pretty close (18r/7w out of a possible 20r/10w), which is good enough for today.</p>

<h3>Update: Linux is slow too!</h3>

<p>I originally tested with <code>hdparm</code>, which reports about 20 MB/s as expected:</p>

<pre><code>$ hdparm -t /dev/mmcblk0
 Timing buffered disk reads:  62 MB in  3.07 seconds =  20.21 MB/sec
</code></pre>

<p>But testing with <code>dd</code>, I don&#8217;t get this speed.
<code>dd</code>&#8217;s speed seems to depend a lot on the block size. Using <code>4096 * 11</code> bytes (which I assume is what dom0 would do in response to a single guest request), I get just 16.9 MB/s:</p>

<pre><code>$ dd iflag=direct if=/dev/vg0/bench of=/dev/null bs=45056 count=1000
1000+0 records in
1000+0 records out
45056000 bytes (45 MB) copied, 2.65911 s, 16.9 MB/s
</code></pre>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th style="text-align: right">Block size (pages)</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Linux dom0</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Linux domU</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right">11</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">17.0 MB/s</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">14.5 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right">16</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">18.8 MB/s</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">16.3 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right">32</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">20.8 MB/s</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">18.6 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So perhaps Mirage is doing pretty well already - it&#8217;s about as fast as the Linux guest.
Xen seems to be the limiting factor here, because it doesn&#8217;t allow us to make large enough requests.</p>

<h2>Profiling the queuing service</h2>

<p>Finally, I looked at applying all this new information to my queuing service.
As a baseline, <code>wget</code> reports that I can currently download from it at 4.6 MB/s, with profiling compiled in but disabled:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/http-download1.png" /></p>

<p>There&#8217;s some complicated copying going on because we&#8217;re using the HTTP Chunked encoding, which writes the size of each chunk of data followed by the data itself, then the next chunk, etc.
Since we know the length at the start, we can use the simpler Fixed encoding.
This increases the speed to 5.2 MB/s.
It&#8217;s a shame the HTTP API uses strings everywhere: we have to copy the data from the disk buffer to a string on the heap to give it to the HTTP API, which then copies it back into a new buffer to send it to the network card.
If it took a stream of buffers, we could just pass them straight through.</p>

<p>Finally, I added the read-ahead support from the block profiling above, which increased the speed to 6.8 MB/s.
Here&#8217;s the new graph, showing that we&#8217;re sending packets much faster (note the change in the Y-scale):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/mirage-profiling/http-download2.png" /></p>

<p>I used a queue length of 5, with 33 sectors per request. I tried increasing it to 10, but that caused more GC work.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Even the unoptimised service is faster than my current (ADSL) Internet connection, so optimising it isn&#8217;t currently necessary, but it&#8217;s interesting to look at performance and get a feel for where the bottlenecks are.</p>

<p>Mirage doesn&#8217;t have any specific profiling support, but the fact that the whole OS is a single executable makes profiling it quite easy.
OCaml&#8217;s <code>profile</code> option isn&#8217;t a perfect fit for tracing because it doesn&#8217;t record when a function finishes, but you can still get useful results from it.
Graphing some metric (e.g. packets sent) over time seemed the most useful way to look at the data.
I&#8217;m currently just using libreoffice&#8217;s chart tool, but I should probably find something more suitable.
It would be great to be able to zoom in easily, show durations (not just events), filter the trace display easily, etc.
I&#8217;d also like support for following Lwt threads even when they block.
Recommendations for good visualisation tools welcome!</p>

<p>Writing to the Xen console from Mirage is slow because <code>xenconsoled</code> rate limits us. Mirage still gets better performance than Linux though, and uses far less CPU (looks like Linux is just spinning). My UDP test kernel sent data faster than Linux&#8217;s <code>nc</code> utility (probably because <code>nc</code> made a poor choice of payload size). Linux does very well on TCP. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s so fast. Using Xen&#8217;s TCP checksum offloading does help a bit though. SD card performance on Mirage is close to what the hardware supports when I choose the right request size and keep two requests in flight at once. It&#8217;s surprising we don&#8217;t manage the full speed, though. For networking and disk access, managing Xen&#8217;s grant refs for the shared memory pages seems to take up a lot of time - maybe there are ways to optimise that.</p>

<p>With a few modifications (TCP checksum offload, HTTP fixed encoding, keeping multiple disk reads in flight and using optimal buffer sizes), I increased the download speed of my test service running on my ARM dev board from 2.46 MB/s to 7.24 MB/s (when compiled without profiling).
I&#8217;m sure people more familiar with Mirage will have more suggestions.</p>

</ul>

<p>Regular readers will know that a few months ago I began a new job at Cambridge University.
Working for an author of Real World OCaml and leader of OCaml Labs, on a project building pure-OCaml distributed systems, who found me through my blog posts about learning OCaml, I thought they might want me to write some OCaml.</p>

<p>But no.
They&#8217;ve actually had me <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-xen-minios-arm">porting the tiny Mini-OS kernel to ARM</a>, using a mixture of C and assembler, to let <a href="http://openmirage.org/">the Mirage unikernel</a> run on ARM devices.
Of course, I got curious and wanted to write a Mirage application for myself&#8230;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Linux, like many popular operating systems, is a <em>multi-user</em> system.
This design dates back to the early days of computing, when a single expensive computer, running a single OS, would be shared between many users.
The goal of the kernel is to protect itself from its users, and to protect the users from each other.</p>

<p>Today, computers are cheap and many people own several.
Even when a physical computer is shared (e.g. in cloud computing), this is typically done by running multiple virtual machines, each serving a single user.
Here, protecting the OS from its (usually single) application is pointless.</p>

<p>Removing the security barrier between the kernel and the application greatly simplifies things;
we can run the whole system (kernel + application) as a single, privileged, executable - a <em>unikernel</em>.</p>

<p>And while we&#8217;re rewriting everything anyway, we might as well replace C with a modern memory safe language, eliminating whole classes of bugs and security vulnerabilities, allowing decent error reporting, and providing structured data types throughout.</p>

<p>In the past, two things have made writing a completely new OS impractical:</p>

<ul>  <li>Legacy applications won&#8217;t run on it.</li>
  <li>It probably won&#8217;t support your hardware.</li>
</ul>

<p>Virtualisation removes both obstacles:
legacy applications can run in their own legacy VMs, and
drivers are only needed for the virtual devices - e.g.
a single network driver and a single block driver will cover all real network cards and hard drives.</p>

<h3>A hello world kernel</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://openmirage.org/wiki/install">mirage tutorial</a> starts by showing the easy, fully-automated way to build a unikernel.
If you want to get started quickly you may prefer to read that and skip this section, but since one of the advantages of unikernels is their relative simplicity, let&#8217;s do things the &#8220;hard&#8221; way first to understand how it works behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the normal &#8220;hello world&#8221; program in OCaml:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>hw.ml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">print_endline</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>To compile and run as a normal application, we&#8217;d do:</p>

<pre><code>$ ocamlopt hw.ml -o hw
$ ./hw 
Hello, world!
</code></pre>

<p>How can we make a unikernel that does the equivalent?
As it turns out, the above code works unmodified (though the Mirage people might frown at you for doing it this way).
We compile hw.ml to a <code>hw.native.o</code> file and then link with the unikernel libraries instead of the standard C library:</p>

<pre><code>$ export OPAM_DIR=$(opam config var prefix)
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$OPAM_DIR/lib/pkgconfig
$ ocamlopt -output-obj -o hw.native.o hw.ml
$ ld -d -static -nostdlib --start-group \
    $(pkg-config --static --libs openlibm libminios-xen) \
    hw.native.o \
    $OPAM_DIR/lib/mirage-xen/libocaml.a \
    $OPAM_DIR/lib/mirage-xen/libxencaml.a \
    --end-group \
    $(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name) \
    -o hw.xen
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a kernel image, <code>hw.xen</code>, which can be booted as a VM under the <a href="http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/hypervisor.html">Xen hypervisor</a> (as used by Amazon, Rackspace, etc to host VMs). But first, let&#8217;s look at the libraries we added:</p>

<dl>  <dt>openlibm</dt>
  <dd>This is a standard maths library. It provides functions such as <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, etc.</dd>
  <dt>libminios-xen</dt>
  <dd>This provides the architecture-specific boot code, a <code>printk</code> function for debugging, <code>malloc</code> for allocating memory and some low-level functions for talking to Xen.</dd>
  <dt>libocaml.a</dt>
  <dd>The OCaml runtime (the garbage collector, etc).</dd>
  <dt>libxencaml.a</dt>
  <dd>OCaml bindings for libminios and some boot code.</dd>
  <dt>libgcc.a</dt>
  <dd>Support functions for code that gcc generates (actually, not needed on x86).</dd>
</dl>

<p>To deploy the new unikernel, we create a Xen configuration file for it (here, I&#8217;m giving it 16 MB of RAM):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>hw.xl </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'hw'</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">kernel</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'hw.xen'</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">memory</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">16</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">on_crash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'preserve'</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">on_poweroff</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'preserve'</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Setting <code>on_crash</code> and <code>on_poweroff</code> to <code>preserve</code> lets us see any output or errors, which would otherwise be missed if the VM exits too quickly.</p>

<p>We can now boot our new VM:</p>

<pre><code>$ xl create -c hw.xl

<p>( Note: I&#8217;m testing locally by running Xen under VirtualBox. Not all of Xen&#8217;s features can be used in this mode, but it works for testing unikernels. I&#8217;m also using my Git version of <code>mirage-xen</code>; the official one will display an error after printing the greeting because it expects you to provide a mainloop too. The warnings about <code>lseek</code> are just OCaml trying to find the current file offsets for <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>.)</p>

<p>As you can see, the boot process is quite short.
Execution begins at <a href="http://xenbits.xenproject.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git%3Ba=blob%3Bf=extras/mini-os/arch/x86/x86_64.S%3Bh=df3469ef4319a75cc9d4c36b51f4097897c015f2%3Bhb=HEAD#l19"><code>_start</code></a>.
Using <code>objdump -d hw.xen</code>, you can see that this just sets up the stack pointer register and calls the C function <code>arch_init</code>:</p>

<pre><code>0000000000000000 &lt;_start&gt;:
       0:   fc                      cld

</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://xenbits.xenproject.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git%3Ba=blob%3Bf=extras/mini-os/arch/x86/setup.c%3Bh=5e87dd1d99014a8139d8a63b375793661e57263b%3Bhb=HEAD#l93">arch_init</a> (in libminios) initialises the traps and FPU and then prints <code>Xen Minimal OS!</code> and information about various addresses.
It then calls <code>start_kernel</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/blob/45814f85acca6174915acbb571146e1c4e978684/xen/runtime/xencaml/main.c#L57">start_kernel</a> (in libxencaml) sets up a few more features (events, interrupts, malloc, time-keeping and grant tables), then calls <code>caml_startup</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/blob/45814f85acca6174915acbb571146e1c4e978684/xen/runtime/ocaml/startup.c#L202">caml_startup</a> (in libocaml) initialises the garbage collector and calls <code>caml_program</code>, which is our <code>hw.native.o</code>.</p>

<p>We call <code>print_endline</code>, which libxencaml, as a convenience for debugging, forwards to libminios&#8217;s <code>console_print</code>.</p>

<h3>Using Mirage libraries</h3>

<p>The above was a bit of a hack, which ended up just using the C console driver in libminios (one of the few things it provides, as it&#8217;s needed for printk).
We can instead use the <code>mirage-console-xen</code> OCaml library, like this:</p>

<p>Mirage uses the usual <code>Lwt</code> library for cooperative threading, which I wrote about at last year in <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/11/28/asynchronous-python-vs-ocaml/">Asynchronous Python vs OCaml</a> - <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> means to wait for the result, allowing other code to run. Everything in Mirage is non-blocking, even looking up the console. <code>OS.Main.run</code> runs the main event loop.</p>

<p>Since we&#8217;re using libraries, let&#8217;s switch to ocamlbuild and give the dependencies in the <code>_tags</code> file, as usual for OCaml projects:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>_tags </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">true: warn(A), strict_sequence, package(mirage-console-xen)</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The only unusual thing we have to do here is tell ocamlbuild not to link in the <code>Unix</code> module when we build <code>hw.native.o</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ocamlbuild -lflags -linkpkg,-dontlink,unix -use-ocamlfind hw.native.o
</code></pre>

<p>In the same way, we can use other libraries to access raw block devices (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-xen">mirage-block-xen</a>), timers (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-clock">mirage-clock-xen</a>) and network interfaces (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/">mirage-net-xen</a>).
Other (non-Xen-specific) OCaml libraries can then be used on top of these low-level drivers.
For example, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-fat">fat-filesystem</a> can provide a filesystem on a block device, while <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip">tcpip</a> provides an OCaml TCP/IP stack on a network interface.</p>

<h3>The mirage-unix libraries</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that the Xen driver libraries we used above ended in <code>-xen</code>.
In fact, each of these is just an implementation of some generic interface provided by Mirage.
For example, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/blob/master/types/V1.mli">mirage/types</a> defines the abstract <code>CONSOLE</code> interface as:</p>

<p>By linking against the <code>-unix</code> versions of libraries rather than the <code>-xen</code> ones, we can compile our code as an ordinary Unix program and run it directly.
This makes testing and debugging very easy.</p>

<p>To make sure our code is generic enough to do this, we can wrap it in a functor that takes any console module as an input:</p>

<h3>The <code>mirage</code> tool</h3>

<p>With the platform-specific code isolated in <code>main.ml</code>, we can now use the <code>mirage</code> command-line tool to generate it automatically for the target platform.
<code>mirage</code> takes a <code>config.ml</code> configuration file and generates <code>Makefile</code> and <code>main.ml</code> based on the current platform and the arguments passed.</p>

<pre><code>$ mirage configure --unix
$ make
$ ./mir-hw 
Hello, world!
</code></pre>

<p>I won&#8217;t describe this in detail because at this point we&#8217;ve reached the start of the <a href="http://openmirage.org/wiki/hello-world">official tutorial</a>, and you can read that instead.</p>

<h2>Test case</h2>

<p>Because <a href="http://0install.net">0install</a> is decentralised, it doesn&#8217;t need a single centrally-managed repository (or several incompatible repositories, each trying to package every program, as is common with Linux distributions).
In 0install, it&#8217;s possible for every developer to run their own <a href="http://0install.net/0repo.html">repository</a>, containing just their software, with cross-repository dependencies handled automatically.
But just because it&#8217;s possible doesn&#8217;t mean we have to go to that extreme: having medium sized repositories each managed by a team of people can be very convenient, especially where package maintainers come and go.</p>

<p>The general pattern for a group repository is to have a public server that accepts new package uploads from developers, and a private (firewalled) server with the repository&#8217;s GPG key, which downloads from it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/0repo-multi.png" /></p>

<p>Debian uses an anonymous FTP server for its incoming queue, polling it with a cron job.
This turns out to be surprisingly complicated.
You need to handle incomplete uploads (not processing them until they&#8217;re done, or deleting them eventually if they never complete), allow contributors to overwrite or delete their own partial uploads (Debian allows you to upload a GPG-signed command file, which provides some control), etc, as well as keep the service fully patched.
Also, the cron system can be annoying: if the package contains a mistake then it will be several minutes before it discovers this and emails the packager.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are some decent systems out there to handle all this, but it seemed like a good opportunity to try making a unikernel.</p>

<p>A particularly nice feature of this test-case is that it doesn&#8217;t matter too much if it fails:
the repository itself will check the developer&#8217;s signature on the files, so an attacker can&#8217;t compromise the repository by breaking into the queue; everything in the queue is intended to become public, so we need not worry much about confidentiality; lost uploads can be easily resubmitted; and if it goes down for a bit, it just means that new software can&#8217;t be added to the repository.
So, there&#8217;s nothing critical about this service, which is reassuring.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/merge-queues">merge-queues</a> library builds a queue abstraction on top of
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin">Irmin</a>, a Git-inspired storage system for Mirage.
But my needs are simple, and I wanted to test the more primitive libraries first, so I decided to build my queue directly on a plain filesystem.
This was the first interface I came up with:</p>

<p>Our <code>unikernel.ml</code> will use this to make a queue, backed by a filesystem.
Uploaders&#8217; HTTP POSTs will be routed to <code>Upload.add</code>, while the repository&#8217;s GET and DELETE invocations go to the <code>Download</code> submodule.
<code>delete</code> is a separate operation because we want the repository to confirm that it got the item successfully before we delete it, in case of network errors.</p>

<p>Ideally, we might require that the <code>DELETE</code> comes over the same HTTP connection as the <code>GET</code> just in case we accidentally run two instances of the repository software, but that&#8217;s unlikely and it&#8217;s convenient to test using separate <code>curl</code> invocations.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re using another functor here, <code>Upload_queue.Make</code>, so that our queue will work over any filesystem.
In theory, we can configure our unikernel with a FAT filesystem on a block device when running under Xen,
while using a regular directory when running under Linux (e.g. for testing).</p>

<p>But it doesn&#8217;t work.
You can see at the top that I had to restrict Mirage&#8217;s abstract <code>FS</code> type in two ways:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>The <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> functions in <code>FS</code> pass the data using the abstract <code>page_aligned_buffer</code> type.
Since we need to do something with the data, this isn&#8217;t good enough.
I therefore declare that this must be a <code>Cstruct.t</code> (basically, an array of bytes).
This is actually OK; <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs-unix">mirage-fs-unix</a> also uses this type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>One of the possible error codes from <code>FS</code> is the abstract type <code>FS.block_device_error</code>, and I can&#8217;t
see any way to turn one of these into a string using the <code>FS</code> interface.
I therefore require a filesystem implementation that defines it to be <code>Fat.Fs.block_error</code>.
Obviously, this means we now only support the FAT filesystem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t prevent us from running as a normal process, because we can ask for a Unix &#8220;block&#8221; device (actually, just a plain <code>disk.img</code> file) and pass that to the <code>Fat</code> module, but it would be nice to have the option of using a real directory.</p>

<p>I asked about this on the mailing list - <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2014-07/msg00048.html">Mirage questions from writing a REST service</a> - and it looks like the <code>FS</code> type will change soon.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>For the curious, this initial implementation is in <a href="https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/blob/063db53c6faf76c7a9edd18416c25459603b777d/upload_queue.ml">upload_queue.ml</a>.</p>

<p>Internally, the module creates an in-memory queue to keep track of successful uploads.
Uploads are streamed to the disk and
when an upload completes with the declared size, the filename is added to the queue.
If the upload ends with the wrong size (probably because the connection was lost), the file is deleted.</p>

<p>But what if our VM gets rebooted?
We need to scan the file system at start up and work out which uploads are complete and which should be deleted.
My first thought was to name the files <code>NUMBER.part</code> during the upload and rename on success.
However, the <code>FS</code> interface currently lacks a <code>rename</code> method.
Instead, I write an <code>N</code> byte to the start of each file and set it to <code>Y</code> on success.
That works, but renaming would be nicer!</p>

<p>For downloading, the <code>peek</code> function returns the item at the head of the queue.
If the queue is empty, it waits until something arrives.
The repository just makes a GET request - if something is available then it returns immediately,
otherwise the connection stays open until some data is ready, allowing the repository to respond immediately to new uploads.</p>

<h3>Unit-testing the storage system</h3>

<p>Because our unikernel can run as a process, testing is easy even if you don&#8217;t have a local Xen deployment.
A set of unit-tests test the upload queue module just as for any other program, and the service can be run as a normal process, listening on a normal TCP socket.
A slight annoyance here is that the generated Makefile doesn&#8217;t include any rules to build the tests so you have to add them manually, and
if you regenerate the Makefile then it loses the new rule.</p>

<p>As you might expect from such a new system, testing uncovered several problems. The first (minor) problem is that when the disk becomes full, the unhelpful error reported by the filesystem is <code>Failure("Unknown error: Failure(\"fault\")")</code>.</p>

<p>( I asked about this on the mailing list - <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2014-07/msg00069.html">Error handling in Mirage</a> - and there seems to be agreement that error handling should change. )</p>

<p>A more serious problem was that deleting files corrupted the FAT directory index.
I downloaded the FAT library and added a unit-test for delete, which made it easy to track the problem down (despite my lack of knowledge of FAT).
Here&#8217;s the code for marking a directory entry as deleted in the FAT library:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s supposed to take an entry, unmarshal it into an OCaml structure, set the <code>deleted</code> flag, and marshal the result into a new <code>delta</code> structure.
These deltas are returned and applied to the device.
The bug is a simple typo: <code>Lfn</code> (long filename) entries update correctly, but for old <code>Dos</code> ones it writes the new block to the input, not to <code>delta</code>.
The fix was simple enough (I also refactored it slightly to encourage the correct behaviour in future):</p>

<p>This demonstrates both the good and the bad of Mirage: the bug was easy to find and fix, using regular debugging tools.
I&#8217;m sure fixing a filesystem corruption bug in the Linux kernel would have been vastly more difficult.
On the other hard, Linux is rather well tested, whereas I appear to be the first person ever to try deleting a file in Mirage!</p>

<h3>The HTTP server</h3>

<p>This turned out to be quite simple. Here&#8217;s the unikernel&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/blob/92c99d34104b6bea707044924f9753a9cc7f0414/unikernel.ml"><code>start</code></a> function:</p>

<p>Here, our functor is extended to take a filesystem (using the restricted type required by our <code>Upload_queue</code>, as noted above) and an HTTP server module as arguments.</p>

<p>The HTTP server calls our <code>callback</code> each time it receives a request, and this dispatches <code>/uploader</code> requests to <code>handle_uploader</code> and <code>/downloader</code> ones to <code>handle_downloader</code>. These are also very simple, e.g.</p>

<h3>Buffered reads</h3>

<p>Running as a <code>--unix</code> process, I initially got a download speed of
17.2 KB/s, which was rather disappointing.
Especially as Apache on the same machine gets 615 MB/s!</p>

<p>Increasing the size of the chunks I was reading from the Fat
filesystem (a disk.img file) from 512 bytes to 1MB, I was able to
increase this to 2.83 MB/s, and removing the <code>O_DIRECT</code> flag from
<code>mirage-block-unix</code>, download speed increased to 15 MB/s (so this is
with Linux caching the data in RAM).</p>

<p>To check the filesystem was the problem, I removed the <code>F.read</code> call
(so it would return uninitialised data instead of the actual file contents).
It then managed a very respectable 514 MB/s.
Nothing wrong with the HTTP code then.</p>

<h3>Streaming uploads</h3>

<p>It all worked nicely running as a Unix process, so the next step was to deploy on Xen.
I was hoping that most of the bugs would already have been found during the Unix testing,
but in fact there were more lurking.</p>

<p>It worked for very small files, but when uploading larger files it quickly ran
out of memory on my 64-bit x86 test system. I also tried it on my 32-bit CubieTruck
ARM board, but that failed even sooner, with <code>Invalid_argument("String.create")</code> (on 32-bit
platforms, OCaml strings are limited to 16 MB).</p>

<p>In both cases, the problem was that the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp">cohttp</a> library tried to read the entire upload in one go.
I found the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/blob/86394acdb580257ee78cb6976966662575b01bb0/cohttp/transfer_io.ml#L56">read</a> function in <code>Transfer_io</code>:</p>

<p>I changed it to use <code>read</code> rather than <code>read_exactly</code> (<code>read</code> returns whatever data is available, waiting only if there isn&#8217;t any at all):</p>

<p>I also had to change the signature to take a mutable reference (<code>remaining</code>) for the remaining data, otherwise it has no way to know when it&#8217;s done (<a href="https://github.com/talex5/ocaml-cohttp/commit/030969c32d310d690b8df5929d9a5f32caee6eb5">patch</a>).</p>

<h3>Buffered writes</h3>

<p>With the uploads now split into chunks, upload speed with <code>--unix</code> was 178 KB/s.
Batching up the chunks (which were generally 4 KB each) into a 64 KB buffer increased the speed to 2083 KB/s.
With a 1 MB buffer, I got 6386 KB/s.</p>

<p>Asking on the mailing list confirmed that
<a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2014-07/msg00054.html">Fat is not well optimised</a>.
This isn&#8217;t actually a problem for my service, since it&#8217;s still faster than
my Internet connection, but there&#8217;s clearly more work needed here.</p>

<h3>Upload speed on Xen</h3>

<p>Testing on my little CubieTruck board, I then got:</p>

<table class="table">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Upload speed</td>
      <td>74 KB/s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>Download speed</td>
      <td>1.6 KB/s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Hmm. To get a feel for what the board is capable of, I ran <code>nc -l -p 8080 &lt; /dev/zero</code> on the board
and <code>nc cubietruck 8080 | pv &gt; /dev/null</code> on my laptop, getting 29 MB/s.</p>

<p>Still, my unikernel is running as a guest, meaning it has the overhead of using the virtual network
interface (it has to pass the data to dom0, which then sends it over the real interface). So I installed
a Linux guest and tried from there. 47.2 MB/s. Interesting. I have no idea why it&#8217;s faster than dom0!</p>

<p>I loaded up <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to see what was happening with the unikernel transfers.
The upload transfer mostly went fast, but stalled in the middle for 15 seconds and then for 12 seconds at the end.
Wireshark showed that the unikernel was ack&#8217;ing the packets but reducing the TCP window size, indicating that the packets weren&#8217;t being processed by the application code.
The delays corresponded to the times when we were flushing the data to the SD card, which makes sense.
So, this looks like another filesystem problem (we should be able to write to the SD card much faster than this).</p>

<h3>TCP retransmissions</h3>

<p>For the download, Wireshark showed that many of the packets had incorrect TCP checksums and were having to be retransmitted.
I was already familiar with this bug from a previous mailing list discussion: <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/mirageos-devel/2014-07/msg00131.html">wireshark capture of failed download from mirage-www on ARM</a>.
That turned out be <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/archives/html/xen-users/2014-07/msg00067.html">a Linux bug</a> - the privileged dom0 code responsible for sending our virtual network packets to the real network becomes confused if two packets occupy the same physical page in memory.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what happens:</p>

<ol>  <li>We read 1 MB of data from the disk and send it to the HTTP layer as the next chunk.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/blob/86394acdb580257ee78cb6976966662575b01bb0/cohttp/transfer_io.ml#L48"><code>Chunked.write</code></a> does the HTTP chunking and sends it to the TCP/IP channel.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/blob/dedd5e0626a3fc8d679e60e92e5fc327c37759bd/channel/channel.ml#L181"><code>Channel.write_string</code></a> writes the HTTP output into pages (aligned 4K blocks of memory).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/blob/dedd5e0626a3fc8d679e60e92e5fc327c37759bd/tcp/pcb.ml#L476"><code>Pcb.writefn</code></a> then determines that each page is too big for a TCP packet and splits each one into smaller chunks, sharing the single underlying page:</li>

<p>My original fix changed <code>mirage-net-xen</code> to wait until the first buffer had been read before sending the second one.
That fixed the retransmissions, but all the waiting meant I still only got 56 KB/s.
Instead, I changed <code>writefn</code> to copy <code>remaining_bit</code> into a new IO page, and with that I got 495 KB/s.</p>

<p>Replacing the filesystem read with a simple <code>String.create</code> of the same length, I got 3.9 MB/s, showing that once again the
FAT filesystem was now the limiting factor.</p>

<h3>Adding a block cache</h3>

<p>I tried adding a <a href="https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/blob/fat-caching/block_cache.ml">block cache</a> layer between <code>mirage-block-xen</code> and <code>fat-filesystem</code>, like this:</p>

<p>With this in place, upload speed remains at 76 KB/s, but the download speed increases to 1 MB/s (for a 20 MB file, which therefore doesn&#8217;t fit in the cache).
This suggests that the FAT filesystem is reading the same disk sectors many times.
Enlarging the memory cache to cover the whole file, the download speed only increases to 1.3 MB/s,
so the FAT code must be doing some inefficient calculations too.</p>

<h3>Replacing FAT</h3>

<p>Since most of my problems seemed to be coming from using FAT, I decided to try a new approach.
I removed all the FAT code and the block cache and changed <code>upload_queue.ml</code> to write directly to the block
device.
With that (no caching), I get:</p>

<table class="table">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Upload speed</td>
      <td>2.27 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>Download speed</td>
      <td>2.46 MB/s</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That&#8217;s not too bad. It&#8217;s faster than my Internet connection, which means that the unikernel is no longer the limiting factor.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the new version: <a href="https://github.com/0install/0repo-queue/blob/master/upload_queue.ml"><code>upload_queue.ml</code></a>.
The big simplification comes from knowing that the queue will spend most of its time empty (another good reason to use a small VM for it).
The code has a <code>next_free_sector</code> which it advances every time an upload starts.
When the queue becomes empty and there are no uploads in progress this variable is reset back to sector 1 (sector 0 holds the index).
This does mean that we may report disk full errors to uploaders even when there is free space on the disk, but this won&#8217;t happen in typical usage because the repository downloads things as soon as they&#8217;re uploaded (if it does happen, it just means uploaders have to wait a couple of minutes until the repository empties the queue).</p>

<p>Managing the block device manually brought a few more advantages over FAT:</p>

<ol>  <li>No need to generate random file names for the uploads.</li>
  <li>No need to delete incomplete uploads (we only write the file&#8217;s index entry to disk on success).</li>
  <li>The system should recover automatically from filesystem corruption because invalid entries can be detected reliably at boot time and discarded.</li>
  <li>Disk full errors are reported correctly.</li>
  <li>The queue ordering isn&#8217;t lost on reboot.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Modern operating systems are often extremely complex, but much of this is historical baggage which isn&#8217;t needed on a modern system where you&#8217;re running a single application as a VM under a hypervisor. Mirage allows you to create very small VMs which contain almost no C code. These VMs should be easier to write, more reliable and more secure.</p>

<p>Creating a bootable OCaml kernel is surprisingly easy, and from there adding support for extra devices is just a matter of pulling in the appropriate libraries. By programming against generic interfaces, you can create code that runs under Linux/Unix/OS X or as a virtual machine under Xen, and switch between configurations using the <code>mirage</code> tool.</p>

<p>Mirage is still very young, and I found many rough edges while writing my queuing service for 0install:</p>

<ul>  <li>While Linux provides fast, reliable filesystems as standard, Mirage currently only provides a basic FAT implementation.</li>
  <li>Linux provides caching as standard, while you have to implement this yourself on Mirage.</li>
  <li>Error reporting should be a big improvement over C&#8217;s error codes, but getting friendly error messages from Mirage is currently difficult.</li>
  <li>The system has clearly been designed for high performance (the APIs generally write to user-provided buffers to avoid copying, much like C libraries do), but many areas have not yet been optimised.</li>
  <li>Buffers often have extra requirements (e.g. must be page-aligned, a single page, immutable, etc) which are not currently captured in the type system, and this can lead to run-time errors which would ideally have been detected at compile time.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there is <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release">a huge amount of work</a> happening on Mirage right now and it looks like all of these problems are being worked on.
If you&#8217;re interested in low-level OS programming and don&#8217;t want to mess about with C, Mirage is a lot of fun, and it can be useful for practical tasks already with a bit of effort.</p>

<p>There are still many areas I need to find out more about.
In particular, using the new <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-ocaml-tls">pure-OCaml TLS stack</a> to secure the system and trying the <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin">Irmin Git-like distributed, branchable storage</a> to provide the queue instead of writing it myself.
I hope to try those soon&#8230;</p>

<h2 style="color: #333333;">Abstract</h2>
<p style="color: #333333;">The Paxos algorithm, despite being synonymous with distributed consensus for a decade, is famously difficult to reason about and implement due to its non-intuitive approach and underspecification. In response, this project implemented and evaluated a framework for constructing fault-tolerant applications, utilising the recently proposed Raft algorithm for distributed consensus. Constructing a simulation framework for our implementation enabled us to evaluate the protocol on everything from understandability and efficiency to correctness and performance in diverse network environments. We propose a range of optimisations to the protocol and released to the community a testbed for developing further optimisations and investigating optimal protocol parameters for real-world deployments.</p>

<p>We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/libref/index.html">standard library</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html">runtime</a>, tools (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/depend.html">ocamldep</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc105">ocamllex</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc107">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual032.html">ocamlbuild</a>, the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html">documentation</a>, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience (see also some <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-previously-worked-on">things we've worked on in previous sessions</a>), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6.45pm.</p>

<p>The front end (i.e. <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/the-compiler-frontend-parsing-and-type-checking.html">the parser and type checker</a>) saw a number of enhancements.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h4>Succinct functor syntax</h4>

<p>Syntax tweaks are always popular, if <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadler's_Law">often contentious</a>.   However, reaching agreement is significantly easier when adding syntax is a simple matter of extending an existing correspondence between two parts of the language.

<h3>The front end</h3>

<p><a name="succinct-functor-syntax"></a></p>

<h4>Succinct functor syntax</h4>

<p>Syntax tweaks are always popular, if <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadler's_Law">often contentious</a>.   However, reaching agreement is significantly easier when adding syntax is a simple matter of extending an existing correspondence between two parts of the language.  For example, it was clear which syntax to use when adding support for <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual021.html#toc73">lazy patterns</a>: since patterns generally mirror the syntax for the values they match, patterns for destructing lazy values should use the same <code>lazy</code> keyword as the expressions which construct them.</p>

<p>A second correspondence in OCaml's syntax relates modules and values.  Module names and variables are both bound with <code>=</code>; module signatures and types are both ascribed with <code>:</code>; module fields and record fields are both projected with <code>.</code>.  The syntax for functors and functions is also similar, but the latter offers a number of shortcuts not available in the module language; you can write</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>instead of the more prolix equivalent:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>but multi-argument functors must be written out in full:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">X</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">R</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Z</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">M</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In February's meeting, <a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas</a> wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/16">patch</a> that adds an analogue of the shorter syntax to the module language, allowing the repeated <code>functor</code> to be left out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">X</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">R</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Z</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">M</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The patch also adds support for a corresponding abbreviation at the module type level.  Defining the type of a multi-argument functor currently involves writing a rather clunky sequence of <code>functor</code> abstractions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">F</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">X</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">R</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Z</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">U</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With Thomas's patch all but the first occurrence of <code>functor</code> disappear:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">F</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">X</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">R</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Z</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">U</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Since Thomas's patch has been merged into trunk, you can try out the new syntax using the <a href="http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/2014.05.27.html#2">4.02.0 beta</a>, which is available as a compiler switch in the OPAM repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">opam switch 4.02.0+trunk
</code></pre></div>
<p>The next step is to find out whether the verbose syntax was a symptom or a cause of the infrequency of higher-order functors in OCaml code.  Will we see a surge in the popularity of higher-order modules as the syntax becomes more accommodating?</p>

<h4>Integer ranges</h4>

<p><a href="http://github.com/dsheets">David</a> started work on extending OCaml's range patterns, which currently support only characters, to support <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on#wiki-integer-range-patterns">integer ranges</a>.  For example, consider the following <a href="https://github.com/ygrek/mldonkey/blob/03896bfc/src/utils/ocamlrss/rss_date.ml#L195-L202">code from MLDonkey</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">mdn</span> <span class="k">with</span>

<span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="o">_</span>                            <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">None</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">None</span>                              <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">None</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Although this is fairly clear, it could be made even clearer if we had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power"><em>less</em> powerful language</a> for expressing the tests involving <code>h</code>.  Since the whole OCaml language is available in the <code>when</code> guard of a case, the reader has to examine the code carefully before concluding that the tests are all simple range checks.  Perhaps worse, using guards inhibits the useful checks that the OCaml compiler performs to determine whether patterns are exhaustive or redundant.  David's patch makes it possible to rewrite the tests without guards, making the simple nature of the tests on <code>h</code> clear at a glance (and making it possible once again to check exhaustiveness and redundancy):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">mdn</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="k">with</span>
  <span class="nc">None</span>      <span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">23</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="bp">false</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">11</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="n">h</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="bp">false</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">12</span>    <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="bp">true</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">11</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="bp">true</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">12</span>    <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="mi">12</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">_</span>                 <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">None</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The work on range patterns led to a robust exchange of views about which other types should be supported -- should we support any enumerable type (e.g. variants with nullary constructors)? or perhaps even any ordered type (e.g. floats or strings)?  For the moment, there seems to be a much clearer consensus in favour of supporting integer types than there is for generalising range patterns any further.</p>

<p><a name="extensible-variants"></a></p>

<h4>Extensible variants</h4>

<p>Since the compiler hacking group only meets for an evening every couple of months or so, most of the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">projects we work on</a> are designed so that it's possible to implement them in a few hours.  <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/">Leo</a>'s proposal for extensible variants is a notable exception, <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2012-01/msg00050.html">predating</a> both the <a href="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html">compiler hacking group</a> and <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2012/10/19/announcing-ocaml-labs.html">OCaml Labs</a> itself.</p>

<p>Extensible variants generalise exceptions: with Leo's patch the exception type <code>exn</code> becomes a particular instance of a class of types that can be defined by the user rather than a special builtin provided by the compiler:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* Define an extensible variant type *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">exn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">..</span>

<span class="c">(* Extend the type with a constructor *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">exn</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nc">Not_found</span>

<span class="c">(* Extend the type with another constructor *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">exn</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nc">Invalid_argument</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="kt">string</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Even better, extensible variants come with all the power of regular variant types: they can take type parameters, and even support GADT definitions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* Define a parameterised extensible variant type *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">..</span>

<span class="c">(* Extend the type with a constructor *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Error</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span>

<span class="c">(* Extend the type with a GADT constructor *)</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">error</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">IntError</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">error</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>On the evening of the last compiler hacking meeting, Leo <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5584#c11335">completed</a> the patch; shortly afterwards it was <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/b56dc4b3df8d022b54f40682a9d5d4168c690413">merged to trunk</a>, ready for inclusion in <a href="http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/2014.05.27.html#2">OCaml 4.02</a>!</p>

<p>Extensible variants are a significant addition to the language, and there's more to them than these simple examples show.  A forthcoming post from Leo will describe the new feature in more detail.  In the meantime, since they've been merged into the 4.02 release candidate, you can try them out with OPAM:</p>

<h4>Lazy record fields</h4>

<p>Not everything we work on makes is destined to make it upstream.  A few years ago, <a href="http://alain.frisch.fr/">Alain Frisch</a> <a href="http://www.lexifi.com/blog/ocaml-extensions-lexifi-semi-implicit-laziness">described</a> an OCaml extension in use at <a href="http://lexifi.com/">Lexifi</a> for marking record fields lazy, making it possible to delay the evaluation of initializing expressions without writing the <code>lazy</code> keyword every time a record is constructed.  Alain's post was received enthusiastically, and lazy record fields seemed like an obvious candidate for inclusion upstream, so in April's meeting Thomas put together a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/48">patch</a> implementing the design.  Although the OCaml team decided not to merge the patch, it led to an enlightening <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/48#issuecomment-41758626">discussion</a> with comments from several core developers, including Alain, who described <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/48#issuecomment-41758626">subsequent, less positive, experience with the feature at Lexifi</a>, and Xavier, who explained the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/48#issuecomment-41779525">rationale underlying the current design</a>.</p>

<h3>The back end</h3>

<p>The OCaml back end (i.e. the <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/the-compiler-backend-byte-code-and-native-code.html">code generation portion of the compiler</a>) also saw a proposed enhancement.</p>

<p><a name="constant-arithmetic-optimization"></a></p>

<h4>Constant arithmetic optimization</h4>

<p>Stephen submitted a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/17">patch</a> improving the generated code for functions that perform constant arithmetic on integers.</p>

<p>In OCaml, integers and characters are <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/memory-representation-of-values.html#table20-1_ocaml">represented as shifted immediate values</a>, with the least significant bit set to distinguish them from pointers.  This makes some arithmetic operations <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/memory-representation-of-values.html#idm181610127856">a little more expensive</a>.  For example, consider a function that <code>int_of_digits</code> that builds an integer from three character digits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="n">int_of_digits</span> <span class="sc">'3'</span> <span class="sc">'4'</span> <span class="sc">'5'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">345</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We might define <code>int_of_digits</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">int_of_digits</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
  <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nn">Char</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nn">Char</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="sc">'0'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> 
   <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nn">Char</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nn">Char</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="sc">'0'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">+</span>
    <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nn">Char</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nn">Char</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="sc">'0'</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Passing the <code>-dcmm</code> flag to ocamlopt shows the results of compiling the function to the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/asmcomp/cmm.mli">C-- intermediate language</a>. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ocamlopt -dcmm int_of_digits.ml
</code></pre></div>
<p>The generated code has the following form (reformatted for readability):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="mi">200</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">96</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span>
 <span class="mi">20</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">96</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span>
  <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">96</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The right shifts convert the tagged representation into native integers, and the final <code>+ 1</code> converts the result back to a tagged integer.</p>

<p>Stephen's patch floats the arithmetic operations that involve constant operands outwards, eliminating most of the tag-munging code in favour of a final correcting addition:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span>
 <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">10766</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Our compiler hacking group defines "compiler" rather broadly.  As a result people often work on improving the standard library and tools as well as the compiler proper.  For example, in recent sessions, David added a small patch to <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6105">expose the is_inet6_addr</a> function, and <a href="http://philippewang.info/">Philippe</a> proposed <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/15">a patch that eliminates unnecessary bounds checking</a> in the buffer module.  The last session also saw <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rp452/">Rapha&#235;l</a> and Simon push a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/1961">number</a> <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/1968">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/1972">patches</a> for integrating <a href="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin">merlin</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)">acme</a> editor to OPAM, improving OCaml support in Plan 9.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Several readers said they&#8217;ve been following this blog without knowing what 0install actually is. So, a quick summary!</p>

<p><a href="http://0install.net/"><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/0install-site.png" /></a></p>

<p>Since 2003, <a href="http://0install.net">0install</a>&#8217;s goal has been to provide secure, cross-platform, decentralised software installation.</p>

<p><strong>Secure</strong> means that 0install doesn&#8217;t grant the software root access when you install it (like most package managers do), and doesn&#8217;t allow packages to conflict with each other (each version of each package goes in its own directory). It should always be safe to &#8220;install&#8221; a program with 0install, though ideally you&#8217;d use a sandbox to actually run it (we&#8217;re still waiting for a decent sandbox to turn up).</p>

<p><strong>Cross-platform</strong> means it works on Linux (it&#8217;s available from the repositories of all the major Linux distributions), Unix, OS X and Windows (the Windows version is a compatible reimplementation in C#, though it does run some of the original code in a subprocess).</p>

<p><strong>Decentralised</strong> means that upstream projects publish their software on their own web-sites. They still get automatic dependency handling (including dependencies on other sites), GPG signatures, automatic updates, roll-back, and support for binary and source packages.
0install can work with the native package manager (e.g. rpm or dpkg) to satisfy dependencies, in addition to downloading them as 0install packages itself.</p>

<p>0install was originally written in C as a Linux kernel module and user-space helper.
It made other software easy to install, but getting 0install itself was rather tricky.
My naive hope was that distributions would include it by default, but needless to say that didn&#8217;t happen.
In 2005, it was redesigned and reimplemented in Python to simplify distribution.</p>

<h2>OCaml migration overview</h2>

<dl>  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/06/09/choosing-a-python-replacement-for-0install/">Replacing Python</a> (Jun 2013)</dt>
  <dd>The subject of rewriting 0install in a compiled language had come up a few times, but in 2013 I had just left my job to take a year off and finally had the time for it. I didn&#8217;t have any idea what language to use so I collected suggestions and tried them all. My test-case was to read the tutorial for each language and reimplement one trivial (4 line) function of 0install in each one. I looked at various factors, including start-up time, binary size, binary compatibility, safety features, diagnostics, ease of writing, support for shared libraries, and static checking.

    <p><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/06/09/choosing-a-python-replacement-for-0install/#speed-and-size"><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/langspeed.png" title="Speed and binary size for the launch helper (dominated by start-up time)." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Speed and binary size for the launch helper (dominated by start-up time).</span></span></a></p>

    <p>There was no very clear conclusion. Rust seemed very promising in the long term, but it was years from being ready. ATS was the fastest and smallest, but too difficult to use. Python and C# were too slow (0install needs fast start-up time). Go did poorly in almost every area I tested. But Haskell and OCaml did surprisingly well.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/06/20/replacing-python-round-2/">Replacing Python: second round</a></dt>
  <dd>I tried Haskell and OCaml on a larger sample, converting 576 lines of Python and comparing the code.
They both did well, especially for detecting problems at compile time, but I found OCaml considerably easier to use. It also ran twice as fast.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/07/07/ocaml-binary-compatibility/">OCaml binary compatibility</a> (Jul)</dt>
  <dd>OCaml can compile to bytecode or to native code. I&#8217;d hoped that the bytecode would allow us to distribute a single binary that would work everywhere (as with Java). In this post I did some experiments to check this. It almost worked, but in the end I gave up; we now build separate binaries for each platform.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/08/31/option-handling-with-ocaml-polymorphic-variants/">Option handling with OCaml polymorphic variants</a> (Aug)</dt>
  <dd>Polymorphic Variants are an unusual and very powerful feature of OCaml&#8217;s type system. I found I was able to take advantage of them to check statically that all of 0install&#8217;s sub-commands handle all their options.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/09/28/ocaml-objects/">Experiences with OCaml objects</a> (Sep)</dt>
  <dd>Even though OCaml programmers rarely use objects, the language&#8217;s support for object-oriented programming was a big help in converting the existing Python code. This post looks at OO programming in OCaml and describes the things that confused me at first.</dd>

  <dd>I add support for downloads to the OCaml, which requires using OCaml&#8217;s support for asynchronous code. I compare it with Python&#8217;s new asyncio system.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/12/20/polymorphism-for-beginners/">Polymorphism for beginners</a> (Dec)</dt>
  <dd>OCaml code is often written without explicit types, letting the compiler infer everything.
However, it&#8217;s helpful to understand the details of the type system when it comes to writing interface files (describing a restricted public interface to a module) and when trying to understand compiler error messages. After muddling through for a while, I decided it was time to understand how it actually worked.

  <dd>I&#8217;ve found OCaml to be very good at detecting problems at compile time and the code has been very reliable. Still, some bugs slip though. In this post, I go over each discovered bug that made it into a Git commit and try to work out why it happened and whether it could have been prevented.

  <dt><a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/02/13/ocaml-what-you-gain/">OCaml: what you gain</a> (Feb)</dt>
  <dd>When I first looked at OCaml, I was mainly focused on making sure the things I needed were still available.
With the port complete, I summarise the things you <em>gain</em> from using OCaml.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Code size</h2>

<p>The final OCaml code was remarkably similar in length to the original Python:</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/retro/0install-loc.png" title="Lines of code, before and after." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Lines of code, before and after.</span></span></p>

<p>The main code is slightly shorter, while the unit-tests are slightly longer (probably because I added some extra ones).
The functionality is the same, except that the OCaml adds the &#8220;0install slave&#8221; command (325 lines of OCaml) and uses Lwt
rather than its own asynchronous framework (483 lines of Python).</p>

<p>The Python code also included some XML files for the GTK user interface (shown in orange). In the OCaml, building the widgets
is instead done directly in the code. The OCaml version includes some module interface files (the <code>mli</code> files, shown in green).
These are used to control how much of a module&#8217;s implementation is visible to other modules. They make the code easier to understand,
but they&#8217;re mostly optional.</p>

<h2>Porting method</h2>

<p>I wanted to avoid having two separate forks of 0install (Python and OCaml).
Then most people would continue using the Python version until the OCaml version was finished, resulting in a sudden switch over and the risk of some major flaw in the whole idea going undiscovered until the end.
Also, it would encourage people to submit bug fixes and features to the Python fork, creating extra porting work for me.
Instead, I used a mix of both languages, slowly migrating functions from Python to OCaml.
The two parts communicated using JSON.</p>

<p>I made sure the complete set of unit-tests passed for every commit and that the software remained fully functional throughout the whole process. The graph below shows the amount of Python and OCaml code over time:</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/retro/0install-loc-time.png" title="Lines of code over time." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Lines of code over time.</span></span></p>

<p>For the first couple of months I was just adding OCaml code, duplicating lots of common helper code. For example, the OCaml version needs to be able to parse the XML selections documents, so that code is ported, but parts of the Python still need that code too, so it can&#8217;t be deleted yet. Once I start deleting Python code, progress is fairly steady until it&#8217;s all gone. A nice benefit of this approach is that you can see clearly where you are in the process.</p>

<p>Initially, I tried doing clean implementations of the code from the specifications. However, the existing code has a lot of special cases for weird systems and backwards-compatibility hacks, and not all of them were unit-tested. Soon, I switched to translating more literally from the Python and then cleaning it up once it was in OCaml. I kept the basic structure of the Python in most places (e.g. the same classes with the same methods). That made things much easier. Once the port was complete, I did some larger refactoring (such as making the XML type immutable). I think this worked well - refactoring is very pleasant in OCaml.</p>

<h2>Binary size</h2>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/retro/binary-size.png" title="Executable image size over time." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Executable image size over time.</span></span></p>

<p>The binary ended up a bit bigger than I&#8217;d like. Adding the GTK and OBus libraries in particular added a lot to the size (though they are optional). The main problem with GTK is that it has to be compiled as a plugin, because we don&#8217;t know if the target system will have libgtk. If we used a single binary and the library wasn&#8217;t present, it would refuse to start. By having it in a plugin we can try to load it, but fall back to console mode if that fails. However, compiling for plugins prevents OCaml from optimising the binary by removing unused library functions, since it doesn&#8217;t know which ones might be needed by the plugins.</p>

<p>The binary is compiled with debug symbols, but compiling without has almost no effect (binary becomes 1.5% smaller).</p>

<h2>Build time</h2>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/retro/build-time.png" title="Build time changes over time." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Build time changes over time.</span></span></p>

<p>A full build takes nearly a minute, which isn&#8217;t too bad. The <code>ocamlbuild</code> command automatically discovers dependencies and rebuilds only what is needed, so incremental builds are usually fast and are generally reliable (the exception is that it doesn&#8217;t notice if you remove or rename a file, but you always get an error message in that case rather than an incorrect build).</p>

<p>Most errors are picked up by the type checker immediately at the start of the build, rather than by the unit-tests at the end. That saves a lot of time.</p>

<p>Two things did speed it up slightly: building the tests and the main binary with a single invocation (saves having to run the dependency checker twice) and turning on parallel builds. Parallel builds didn&#8217;t help as much as I&#8217;d hoped however.</p>

<p>Update: edwintorok <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7860192">profiled the build</a> and noticed that 25.5% of the time is spent running a bytecode version of the camlp4 pre-processor (which we use for the Lwt syntax extension and for conditional compilation) and 10.5% is spent on a bytecode version of ocamlfind (looks like an ocamlbuild bug). 
<a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/ocamlbuild-parallelization/">Why ocamlbuild&#8217;s parallelization is often disappointing today</a> looks interesting too.</p>

<p>Update 2: I noticed that building while the computer is busy doing something else is much faster! Looks like this is the Linux scaling governor being strange. Echoing &#8220;performance&#8221; to <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-3]/cpufreq/scaling_governor</code> takes the build time (on my new laptop) down from 45s to 23s!</p>

<p>There are some changes (module aliases) coming in OCaml 4.02 which should help. Currently, if I change one of the files in the <code>Support</code> module (e.g. <code>Support.Sat</code>) then it first rebuilds <code>Sat</code>, then rebuilds <code>Support</code> with the new <code>Sat</code> module, then rebuilds everything that uses <code>Support</code> (which is everything). In reality, it only needs to rebuild <code>Zeroinstall.Solver</code> when <code>Sat</code> changes.</p>

<p>If you do need to modify one of the early modules and run the unit tests quickly, a good trick is to compile to byte-code rather than to native. The byte-code compiler doesn&#8217;t do cross-module inlining optimisations, which means that as long as a module&#8217;s interface doesn&#8217;t change, it doesn&#8217;t need to recompile the things that depend on it.</p>

<p>One interesting feature of the graph is that during December the build time increased faster in proportion to the lines of code added.
This corresponds to the time I was implementing the GTK GUI, so it looks like GUI code takes longer to compile than normal code of the same length.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>And the final result: running various operations with the old and new versions:</p>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th style="text-align: right">Test</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Python 3</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">OCaml</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Speed-up</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right"><code>0install --help</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: right">103 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">8 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">12.9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right"><code>0install select 0repo</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: right">322 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">38 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">8.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right"><code>0install run -w echo armagetron</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: right">120 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">15 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">8.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td style="text-align: right"><code>0install run armagetron --version</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: right">153 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">45 ms</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">3.4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The first (<code>--help</code>) shows the overhead of running 0install and producing some simple output.
The extra speed here really helps with tab-completion!
The second test (<code>select</code>) shows 0install running its SAT solver to select a compatible set of libraries to run the &#8220;0repo&#8221; application.
The third shows 0install setting up the environment to run Armagetron (<code>-w echo</code> echos the executable path rather than actually running it) and the fourth shows it actually running the program.</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/retro/times.png" title="Speed of 0install in Python vs OCaml." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Speed of 0install in Python vs OCaml.</span></span></p>

<p>One other nice win is the time taken to run the unit-tests, which has dropped considerably:</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" height="" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/retro/0install-test-times.png" title="Time to run the unit tests (in seconds)." width="" /><span class="caption-text">Time to run the unit tests (in seconds).</span></span></p>

<p>The spike in the middle is the effect of the JSON bridge, where many tests involved communication between the Python and OCaml parts.</p>

<p>In theory, OUnit should be able to run the tests in parallel on multi-core systems, which would make it even faster, but a <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1363&amp;group_id=162&amp;atid=730">bug in OUnit</a> means it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s surprising to me how reliable the initial tests were.
Even though I only converted 4 lines of Python, the tests uncovered pretty much all of OCaml&#8217;s weaker aspects (non-portable bytecode, lack of support for shared libraries, relatively large binary size, and somewhat terse error messages from the standard library), meaning there were no nasty surprises during the migration.</p>

<p>However, the testing was less successful at uncovering the benefits (excellent type checking, reliability, exhaustive pattern matching, polymorphic variants, abstract types, easy GTK bindings, and API stability).</p>

<p>Blogging about the whole process was extremely useful, attracting many helpful comments, suggestions and corrections from experienced OCaml users.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>The blog attracted the attention of the OCaml folks at Cambridge University, who do all kinds of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/news/index.html#Dec%202013">interesting OCaml things</a>.
As a result, I&#8217;m now working there, adding ARM support to the <a href="http://openmirage.org/">Mirage unikernel</a> - an operating system written in OCaml (the Mirage web-site is all implemented in OCaml, down to and including the TCP/IP stack!).
That will have to be the subject for another blog post though&#8230;</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m describing might sound familiar and there&#8217;s a well-known tool that
does this called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet</a>. It&#8217;s a &#8216;river of news&#8217; feed reader, which
aggregates feeds and can display posts on webpages and you can find the
<a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">original Planet</a> and it&#8217;s successor <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/index.html">Venus</a>, both written in Python.
However, Venus seems to be unmaintained as there are a number of
<a href="https://github.com/rubys/venus/issues">unresolved issues and pull requests</a>, which have been
languishing for quite some time with no discussion. There does appear to be
a more active Ruby implementation called <a href="http://feedreader.github.io/">Pluto</a>, with recent commits and
no reported issues.</p>



<h3>Benefits of a Planet in pure OCaml</h3>

<p>Although I could use the one of the above options, it would be much more
useful to keep everything within the OCaml ecosystem.  This way I can make
the best use of the <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">unikernel approach</a> with Mirage (i.e lean,
single-purpose appliances). Obviously, the existing options don&#8217;t lend
themselves to this approach and there are <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1349&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=101">known bugs</a> as a lot has
changed on the web since Planet Venus (e.g the adoption of HTML5).
Having said that, I can learn a lot from the existing implementations and
I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not embarking into completely uncharted territory.</p>

<p>In addition, the OCaml version doesn&#8217;t need to (and <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em>) be written
as one monolithic library.  Instead, pulling together a collection of
smaller, reusable libraries that present clear interfaces to each other
would make things much more maintainable. This would bring substantially
greater benefits to everyone and <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a> can manage the dependencies. </p>



<h3>Breaking down the problem</h3>

<p>The first cut is somewhat straightforward as we have a piece that deals with
the consumption and manipulation of feeds and another that takes the result
and emits HTML. This is also how the original Planet is put together, with a
library called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser/">feedparser</a> and another for templating pages.  </p>

<p>For the feed-parsing aspect, I can break it down further by considering Atom
and RSS feeds separately and then even further by thinking about how to (1)
consume such feeds and (2) output them. Then there is the HTML component,
where it may be necessary to consider existing representations of HTML. These
are not new ideas and since I&#8217;m claiming that individual pieces might be
useful then it&#8217;s worth finding out which ones are already available.</p>

<h4>Existing components</h4>

<p>The easiest way to find existing libraries is via the
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages">OPAM package list</a>. Some quick searches for <code>RSS</code>, <code>XML</code>, <code>HTML</code>
and <code>net</code> bring up a lot of packages. The most relevant of these seem to be
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmlm/xmlm.1.2.0/">xmlm</a>, <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlrss/ocamlrss.2.2.2/">ocamlrss</a>, <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/cow/cow.0.9.1/">cow</a> and maybe <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmldiff/xmldiff.0.1/">xmldiff</a>. I noticed that
nothing appears, when searching for <code>Atom</code>, but I do know that <code>cow</code> has an
Atom module for creating feeds. In terms of turning feeds into pages and
HTML, I&#8217;m aware of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/script/rss2html.ml">rss2html</a> used on the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> website and parts of
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlnet/ocamlnet.3.7.3/">ocamlnet</a> that may be relevant (e.g <code>nethtml</code> and <code>netstring</code>) as well as
<code>cow</code>.  There is likely to be other code I&#8217;m missing but this is useful as a
first pass. </p>

<p>Overall, a number of components are already out there but it&#8217;s not obvious
if they&#8217;re compatible (e.g html) and there are still gaps (e.g atom). Since
I also want to minimise dependencies, I&#8217;ll try and use whatever works but
may ultimately have to roll my own. Either way, I can learn from what
already exists. Perhaps I&#8217;m being overconfident but if I can break things
down sensibly and keep the scope constrained then this should be an
achievable project. </p>

<h3>The first (baby) steps - an Atom parser</h3>

<p>As this is an exercise for me to learn OCaml by solving a problem, I need to
break it down into bite-size pieces and take each one at a time. Practically
speaking, this means limiting the scope to be as narrow as possible while
still producing a useful result <em>for me</em>.  That last part is important as I
have specific needs and it&#8217;s likely that the first thing I make won&#8217;t be
particularly interesting for many others. </p>

<p>For my specific use-case, I&#8217;m only interested in dealing with Atom feeds as
that&#8217;s what I use on my site and others I&#8217;m involved with. Initial feedback
is that creating an Atom parser will be the bulk of the work and I should
start by defining the types. To keep this manageable, I&#8217;m only going to deal
with my own feeds instead of attempting a fully compliant parser (in other
words, I&#8217;ll only consider the subset of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">RFC4287</a> that&#8217;s relevant to me).
Once I can parse, merge and write such feeds I should be able to iterate
from there. </p>

<p>To make my requirements more concrete:</p>

<ul>  <li>Only consider <em>my own</em> Atom feeds for now</li>
  <li>Initially, be able to parse and emit just one Atom feed</li>
  <li>Then be able to merge 2+ feeds, specifically:
    <ul>      <li>Use tag-based feeds from my personal site as starting points</li>
      <li>Be able to de-dupe content</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No database or storage (construct it afresh every time)</li>
  <li>Minimise library dependencies</li>
</ul>



<h4>Timeframes and workflow</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve honestly no idea how long this might take and I&#8217;m treating it as a
side-project. I know there are many people out there who could produce a
working version of everything in a week or two but I&#8217;m not one of them (yet).
There are also <em>a lot</em> of ancillary things I need to learn on the way, like
packaging, improving my knowledge of Git and dealing with build systems. If
I had to put a vague time frame on this, I&#8217;d be thinking in months rather
than weeks.  It might even be the case that others start work on parts of
this and ship things sooner but that&#8217;s great as I&#8217;ll probably be able to use
whatever they create and move further along the chain.</p>

<p>In terms of workflow, everything will be done in the open, warts and all, and
I expect to make embarrassing mistakes as I go. You can follow along on my
freshly created <a href="https://github.com/amirmc/ocamlatom">OCaml Atom</a> repo, and I&#8217;ll be using the issue tracker as
the main way of dealing with bugs and features. Let the fun begin.</p>

We'll have suggestions for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience (see also some <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-previously-worked-on">things we've worked on in previous sessions</a>), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6.30pm.</p>

<p><strong>A note on bias</strong></p>

<p>I started these blog posts unemployed (taking a career break), with no particular connection to any of the languages, and motivated to make a good choice since I&#8217;d be using it a lot. I wasn&#8217;t biased towards OCaml; it wasn&#8217;t even on my list of candidates until a complete stranger <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/6914/match=ocaml">suggested it on the mailing list</a>.
But I must now disclose that, since my last blog post, I&#8217;m now getting paid for writing OCaml.</p>

<h2>Functional programming</h2>

<p>Some people commented it was good to see more projects moving to functional programming. So, what&#8217;s it like doing functional programming after Python? To be honest, not much has changed. According to OCaml&#8217;s <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/functional_programming.html">What is functional programming?</a>, &#8220;In a functional language, functions are first-class citizens&#8221; and &#8220;The fact is that Perl is actually quite a good functional language&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;ve ever used Python&#8217;s (built-in) <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>filter</code> or <code>apply</code> functions, ever written or used a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorator</a> or ever passed a function as an argument to another function, you&#8217;re already doing functional programming as far as OCaml is concerned. By contrast, &#8220;<em>pure</em> functional programming&#8221; (as in Haskell) would be a major change.</p>

<p>OCaml does make partially applying functions easier, which is sometimes convenient, and it supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion</a>. Tail recursion allows you to write loops in a functional style (without needing <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code> or mutable state). That can make it easier to reason about loops, but I couldn&#8217;t find any examples in 0install where this style was clearly better than a plain Python loop.</p>

<h2>Type-checking</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve used statically-typed languages before (I used to program in Java for my day job). That can catch many errors that Python would miss, but OCaml&#8217;s type system is far more useful than Java&#8217;s. Here&#8217;s an example, where we want to display an icon for some program in the GUI:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">get_icon</span> <span class="n">program</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">set_icon</span>	<span class="c">(* Error! *)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<pre><code>Error: This expression has type Icon.t -&gt; unit
       but an expression was expected of type Icon.t option -&gt; 'a
</code></pre>

<p>Oops. The program might not have an icon (icons are optional). We&#8217;ll need to use a default one in that case:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">get_icon</span> <span class="n">program</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">default</span> <span class="n">generic_program_icon</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">set_icon</span>

<p>Java makes you do all the work for static type checking, but manages to miss many of the benefits.
No matter how much care you take with your Java types, there&#8217;s always a good chance you&#8217;re going to crash with a NullPointerException.
By requiring correct handling of <code>None</code> (<code>null</code>) and ensuring pattern matching is exhaustive, OCaml&#8217;s type checking is far more useful. As with Haskell, when a piece of OCaml code compiles successfully, there&#8217;s a very good chance it will work first time.</p>

<p>And, of course, static checking makes refactoring much easier than in Python. For example, if you remove or rename something, the compiler will always find every place you need to update.</p>

<h2>Data type definitions</h2>

<p>OCaml makes it really easy to define new data types as you need them. The types are always easy to see, and you know that OCaml will enforce them (unlike comments in Python, which may be incorrect). Here&#8217;s a record type for the configuration settings for an interface (an optional stability level and a list of extra feeds):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">interface_config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">stability_policy</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">stability_level</span> <span class="n">option</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">extra_feeds</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nn">Feed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">feed_import</span> <span class="kt">list</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>And here&#8217;s a variant (enum / tagged union / sum) type for the result of a download:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">download_result</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">[</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">aborted_by_user</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2>Polymorphic variants</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/labels.html#Morevariantspolymorphicvariants">OCaml labels tutorial</a> describes polymorphic variants as a way to use the same name (e.g. <code>Open</code>) for different things (e.g. opening a door vs opening a lock) and says:</p>

<blockquote>  <p>&#8220;Because of the reduction in type safety, it is recommended that you don&#8217;t use these in your code&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quite misleading (and I was <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/6975/focus=6977">quickly corrected</a> when I repeated it).
Their real purpose is to support subsets and supersets, which are useful all over the place. Some examples:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>The &#8220;0install&#8221; command-line parser accepts a large number of options. The &#8220;0install run&#8221; subcommand accepts a subset of these. That subset can be further subdivided into common options (present in all commands, such as <code>--verbose</code>), options common to selection commands (e.g. <code>--before=VERSION</code>) and those specific to &#8220;0install run&#8221; (e.g. <code>--wrapper=COMMAND</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>The GUI code that handles dialog responses (<code>OK</code>, <code>Cancel</code>, etc) must handle the union of all the action button responses it added and the always-present window close icon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>The download code only handles the subset of feed URLs that represent remote resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Users can only register local and remote feeds to an interface, not distribution-provided virtual feeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Cached feeds contain only remote implementations, local feeds contain local and remote implementations, and distribution feeds contain only distribution implementations. All three types get combined together and passed to the solver.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example, showing the <code>run</code> command dividing its options into sub-groups, with the compiler checking that every option will be handled in all cases:</p>

<p>Without polymorphic variants, OCaml&#8217;s exhaustive matching requirements mean you&#8217;d have to provide code to handle cases that (you think) can&#8217;t happen. That&#8217;s tedious and your program will crash if you get it wrong. Polymorphic variants mean you can prove to the compiler that only the correct subset needs to be handled at each point in the code. This is fantastic, and I can&#8217;t think of any other major language that does this (though I&#8217;m sure people will suggest some in the comments).</p>

<h2>Immutability</h2>

<p>In OCaml, all variables and record fields are immutable by default. This is far saner than Java (where the default is mutable and you must use <code>final</code> everywhere to override it). Immutable is a better default because:</p>

<ul>  <li>Typically, you want most things to be immutable (in any language).</li>
  <li>If you forget to mark something as mutable, the compiler will quickly let you know, whereas forgetting to mark something as immutable would be missed.</li>
</ul>

<p>With mutable structures, you are always worrying about whether one piece of code will mutate a structure that another is relying on. For example, I originally made the XML element type mutable, but I found I was writing comments like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="c">(** Note: this returns the actual internal XML; don't modify it *)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">as_xml</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">selections</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">element</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>After removing the <code>mutable</code> annotations from the <code>element</code> declaration, the compiler showed me each piece of code I needed to modify to make it work again. Then, I was able to remove those notes.</p>

<p>[ The main difficulty in this conversion was handling XML namespace prefixes. Previously, each element had a reference to its owning document, which held a shared (mutable) pool of prefix bindings. Now, each namespaced item holds its preferred prefix, and the output code builds up a set of bindings before writing out the tree. ]</p>

<p>There is one case where Python and Java do better than OCaml: OCaml strings are mutable! The convention is to treat them as immutable, though.</p>

<p>Update: OCaml 4.02 has an option for immutable strings, with a separate <code>Bytes.t</code> for mutable byte arrays.</p>

<h2>Abstraction</h2>

<p>OCaml makes it very easy to hide a module&#8217;s implementation details from its users using <em>abstract types</em>.</p>

<p>I gave one example in the <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/01/07/ocaml-the-bugs-so-far/#sorted-treeview-iter-mix-up">bugs post</a>, where hiding the fact that a sorted tree is really the same type as an unsorted one prevents bugs due to mixing them up.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another example. In the Python code, we would parse a selections XML document into a <code>Selections</code> object, like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Selections</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">root_element</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I found all this parsing and serialising complicated things and so in the OCaml rewrite I decided to use the plain XML element type everywhere.
That did simplify things, but it also removed some safety and clarity from the APIs.
Consider the <code>Selections.create</code> function (which now does nothing unless the document is in an old format and needs to be upgraded):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">create</span> <span class="n">root</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="nn">ZI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">check_tag</span> <span class="s2">"selections"</span> <span class="n">root</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">is_latest_format</span> <span class="n">root</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="n">root</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">convert_to_latest</span> <span class="n">root</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It&#8217;s nice and simple, but it just returns an <code>element</code>. It would be easy to pass some other XML element to a function that only works on selection documents (or to pass a document that&#8217;s still in the old format).
We can solve this simply by declaring an abstract type for selection documents in the interface file (<code>selections.mli</code>):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">t</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">create</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">element</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>(note: it&#8217;s an OCaml convention for a module&#8217;s main type to be called <code>t</code>; other modules will refer to this type as <code>Selections.t</code>)</p>

<p>I think this gets the best of both worlds. Internally, a selections object is just the XML root element, which is simple and efficient, but code using it can&#8217;t mix up the types. And, of course, we can change the internal type later if needed without breaking anything.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a particularly novel idea (you can do something similar in C). However, Python and Java would require you to write a wrapper object around the object you want to hide, and Python makes it easy for users of the API to access the internal representation even then. If you&#8217;re writing a library, OCaml (like C) makes it clear when you&#8217;re changing the module&#8217;s interface vs merely changing its implementation.</p>

<p>( There is another interesting feature, which I haven&#8217;t used yet: you can use the &#8220;private&#8221; modifier to say that users of the module can see the structure of the type but can&#8217;t create their own instances of it. For example, saying <code>type t = private element</code> would allow users to cast a selections value to an XML element, but not to treat any old XML as a selections value. )</p>

<p>I did experience one case where abstraction didn&#8217;t work as intended. In the SAT solver, I declared the type of a literal abstractly as <code>type lit</code> and, internally, I used <code>type lit = int</code> (an array index). That worked fine. Later, I changed the internal representation from an int to a record. Ideally, that would have no effect on users of the module, but OCaml allows testing abstract types for equality, which resulted in each comparison recursively exploring the whole SAT problem. It can also cause runtime crashes if it encounters a function in this traversal. Haskell&#8217;s type classes avoid this problem by letting you control which types can be compared and how the comparison should be done.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>Python is well known for being slow, but much of what real programs do is simply calling C libraries.
For example, when calculating a SHA256 digest, C does all the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Despite this, I&#8217;ve found OCaml to be fairly consistently 10 times faster in macro benchmarks (measuring a complete run of 0install from start to finish). Also, although I&#8217;ve added a lot of code and dependencies since the initial benchmarks, it still runs almost as quickly.
<a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/06/20/replacing-python-round-2/#speed">The 0release benchmark</a> took 8ms with June&#8217;s minimal version, compared to 10ms with the final version.</p>

<p>When doing pure calculations (e.g. a tight loop adding integers), OCaml is typically more than 100x faster than Python.</p>

<p>Even so, OCaml is probably not a great choice for CPU-intensive programs. Like Python, it has a global lock, so you can&#8217;t have multiple threads all using the CPU at once. But if you&#8217;re writing small utilities that need to run quickly, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>

<p>Update: There is a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Multicore-OCaml">multicore</a> OCaml branch under development which removes the global lock.</p>

<h2>No dependency cycles</h2>

<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m making a virtue of a flaw here, but I like the fact that OCaml doesn&#8217;t allow cyclic dependencies between source files.
I think this leads to cleaner code (back when I was writing Java, I wrote a script to extract all module dependencies and graph them so I could find and eliminate cycles).</p>

<p>What this means is that in any OCaml code-base, no matter how complex, there&#8217;s always at least one module that doesn&#8217;t depend on any of the others and which you can therefore read first.
Then there&#8217;s a second module that only depends on the first one, etc.
For example, here are the modules that make up 0install&#8217;s GTK plugin (note the lack of cycles):</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/guideps.png" /></p>

<p>Cycles can be a problem when converting existing code to OCaml, though. For example, the Python had a <code>helpers.py</code> module containing various high-level helper functions (e.g. <code>get_selections_gui</code> to run the GUI and return the user&#8217;s selections, and <code>ensure_cached</code> to make sure some selections are cached and download them if not). That doesn&#8217;t work in OCaml, because the helpers module depends on the GUI, but the GUI also depends on the helpers (the GUI sometimes needs to ensure things are cached). The result is that I had to move each helper function to the module it uses, but I don&#8217;t mind because the result is a clearer API.</p>

<p>Another example is the <code>Config</code> object. When I started the Python code back in 2005, I was very excited about using the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> for connecting together software modules (this is the basis of how 0install runs programs). Yet, for some reason I can&#8217;t explain, it didn&#8217;t occur to me to use a dependency injection style <em>within</em> the code. Instead, I made a load of singleton objects. Later, in an attempt to make things more testable, I moved all the singletons to a <code>Config</code> object and passed that around everywhere. I wasn&#8217;t proud of this design even at the time, but it was the simplest way forward. It looked like this:</p>

</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line">	<span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>OCaml really didn&#8217;t like this design! <code>config.py</code> depends on all the other modules because it calls their constructors, while they all depend on it to get their dependencies.</p>

<p>Note that this design isn&#8217;t very safe: <code>Fetcher</code>&#8217;s constructor could ask for <code>config.trust_mgr</code>, and <code>TrustMgr</code>&#8217;s constructor could ask for <code>config.fetcher</code>. In Python, we have to remember not to do that, but in OCaml we&#8217;d like the type checker to prove it can&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>In most places, I fixed this by passing to each constructor just the objects it actually needs, which is cleaner.</p>

<p>Another approach, which I used when lots of objects were needed, is that instead of requiring a <code>config</code> object, a class can take simply &#8220;an object with at least <code>fetcher</code> and <code>trust_mgr</code> methods&#8221;.
Then we know statically that it will only call those methods, even though we actually give it the full config object.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that you can look at e.g. the <code>fetch.mli</code> interface file and see exactly which other modules it depends on, none of which will depend on it.</p>

<h2>GUI code</h2>

<p>Converting the GTK GUI to OCaml (using the <a href="http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/">LablGtk</a> bindings), I replaced <strong>5166</strong> lines of Python (<strong>plus 1736</strong> lines of GtkBuilder XML) with <strong>4017</strong> lines of OCaml (and no XML). I&#8217;m not sure why, but writing GTK code in OCaml just seems to be much easier than with Python.</p>

<p>I used GtkBuilder in the Python code in the hope that it would make it easier to modify the layouts, and to improve reliability (since the XML should always be valid, whereas Python code might not be). However, it actually made things harder because Glade (the editor) is constantly trying to force you to upgrade to the latest (incompatible) XML syntax, and I ended up having to run an old OS in a VM any time I wanted to edit things.</p>

<p>In the OCaml, the static type checking gives us similar confidence that the layout code won&#8217;t crash. Also, with GtkBuilder you name each widget in the XML and then search for these names in the code. If they don&#8217;t match, it will fail at runtime. Having everything in OCaml meant that couldn&#8217;t happen. [ Note: I later discovered that LablGtk doesn&#8217;t support GtkBuilder anyway. ]</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of some OCaml GTK code and the corresponding Python code. This shows how to build and display a menu (simplified to have just one item):</p>

<p>Some points to note:</p>

<ul>  <li>LablGtk allows you to specify many properties at once in the constructor call, whereas in PyGTK we need separate calls for each.</li>
  <li>The Python API broke between Python 2 and Python 3, so we have to make sure to use the right one. It&#8217;s not sufficient to test the Python code using only one version of Python!</li>
  <li>The Python bindings have always suffered from garbage collection bugs. If we don&#8217;t store <code>menu</code> in a global variable, it may garbage collect the menu while the user is still choosing - this makes the menu disappear suddenly from the screen!</li>
  <li>Actually, I see that Python&#8217;s <code>MenuItem</code> takes a <code>label</code> argument, so maybe I could save a line. Or maybe that doesn&#8217;t work on some older version. It&#8217;s not worth the risk of changing it.</li>

<p>Update: I used the original layout for the OCaml above as I was comparing line counts, but it&#8217;s a bit wide for this narrow blog and some people are finding it hard to read. Here&#8217;s an expanded version which uses less special syntax:</p>

<p>Here, <code>~</code> indicates a named argument and <code>#</code> is a method call. So <code>menu_item ~packing:menu#add ...</code> is like <code>menu_item(packing = menu.add, ...)</code> in Python.</p>

<p>However, I did still have a few problems with the OCaml GTK bindings:</p>

<ul>  <li>There&#8217;s no support for custom cell renderers. I used three of these in the Python version and had to find alternative UIs for each.</li>
  <li>Various minor functions aren&#8217;t included for some reason. The ones I wanted but couldn&#8217;t find were <code>Dialog.add_action_widget</code>, <code>Style.paint_arrow</code>, <code>MessageDialog.BUTTONS_NONE</code>, <code>Dialog.set_keep_above</code>, <code>icon_size_lookup</code> and <code>Selection_data.get_uris</code>.</li>
  <li>I had to work around a <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/01/07/ocaml-the-bugs-so-far/#crashes-with-gtkiconview">bug in the IconView support</a> (reported <s>but with no response</s> and fixed immediately, although the bug report wasn&#8217;t updated).</li>
  <li>You usually don&#8217;t need the result of creating a label or attaching a signal so you need to use <code>ignore</code>, which can cause silent failures if you forgot an argument (it will ignore the partial function rather than the widget or signal result). Probably I should make <code>ignore_signal</code> and <code>ignore_widget</code> utility functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Update: I did add <code>ignore_widget</code>, but for signals I found a better solution: I created a new <code>==&gt;</code> operator to connect a signal and ignore the resulting signal ID. It&#8217;s used like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<h2>API stability</h2>

<p>This is a community thing rather than a language issue, but OCaml and OCaml libraries seem to be very good at maintaining backwards compatibility at the source level. 0install supports the old OCaml 3.12 and libraries in Ubuntu 12.04 up to the latest OCaml 4.01 release without any problems. The only use of conditional compilation for compatibility is that we don&#8217;t define the <code>|&gt;</code> operator on 4.01 because it&#8217;s already a built-in (this avoids a warning).</p>

<p>On the other hand, binary compatibility is very poor. You can replace the implementation of a module with a newer version as long as the public interface doesn&#8217;t change (good), but any change at all to the interface requires everything that depends on it to be recompiled, and then everything that depends on them, and so on.</p>

<p>For example, if the <code>List</code> module adds a new function then the signature of the <code>List</code> module changes. Now any program using the new version of the <code>List</code> module is incompatible with every library binary compiled against the old version. Even if nothing is even using the new function! This means that distributing OCaml libraries in binary form is effectively impossible.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>OCaml&#8217;s main strengths are correctness and speed. Its type checking is very good at catching errors, and its &#8220;polymorphic variants&#8221; are a particularly useful feature, which I haven&#8217;t seen in other languages. Separate module interface files, abstract types, cycle-free dependencies, and data structures that are immutable by default help to make clean APIs.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, writing GTK GUI code in OCaml was easier than in Python. The resulting code was significantly shorter and, I suspect, will prove far more reliable. OCaml&#8217;s type checking is particularly welcome here, as GUI code is often difficult to unit-test.</p>

<p>The OCaml community is very good at maintaining API stability, allowing the same code to compile on old and new systems and (hopefully) minimising time spent updating it later.</p>

<p>For each element of a stream, <code>iter_stream</code> wraps the element with <code>Some</code>, then unwraps it again and passes it to <code>f</code>.  At first glance, wrapping and immediately unwrapping in this way seems like needless obfuscation.  However, moving the last two lines out of the body of the <code>try</code> in this way serves two essential purposes: it turns the recursive call to <code>iter_stream</code> into a tail call, and it allows exceptions raised by <code>f</code> to propagate.  More generally, this use of options makes it easy to specify the <em>success continuation</em> of a <code>try</code> expression, i.e. the piece of code that receives the value of the body when no exception is raised.</p>

<p>As Simon notes, the <code>match (try Some ...)</code> idiom is widely used in OCaml code.  Examples can be found in the source of <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/blob/b63b2a/src/unix/lwt_unix.ml#L118-L125">lwt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included/blob/92ea390c/benchsuite/bench_nreplace.ml#L45-L48">batteries</a>, <a href="https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/blob/a81cd8b6/src/decoder/metadata_decoder.ml#L53-L55">liquidsoap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/sexplib/blob/f9bd413/lib/conv.ml#L256-L259">sexplib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/blob/0802728/compiler/opalang/opaParser.ml#L127-L135">opa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-uri/blob/35af64db/lib/uri.ml#L250-L255">uri</a>, <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/724c9c9f/tools/coqdoc/tokens.ml#L36-L41">coq</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pascal-bach/Unison/blob/4788644/src/ubase/prefs.ml#L97-L106">unison</a>, and many other packages.  </p>

<p>In response to Simon's message, <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp">Oleg</a> pointed out <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2014-01/msg00146.html">a solution</a>: the 2001 paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/sml/exceptionalsyntax.pdf">Exceptional Syntax</a>  (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/">Benton</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/">Kennedy</a>) extends <code>try</code> with a <code>let</code>-like binding construct that supports the success continuation idiom directly without the need for the option value.</p>



<p>This post describes a patch to OCaml that implements a variant of Benton and Kennedy's design called <em>handler case</em>.  Like Exceptional Syntax, handler case extends <code>try</code> with explicit success continuation handling.  However, unlike Exceptional syntax, handler case uses <code>match</code> binding for both the success continuation and the exception-handling clauses.  Here's the extended <code>try</code> syntax:</p>

   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">pattern_n'</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_n'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As in <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/expr.html#@manual.kwd50">current OCaml</a>, the clauses <code>pattern_1 -&gt; expr_1</code> ... <code>pattern_n -&gt; expr_n</code> handle exceptions raised during the evaluation of <code>expr</code>.  The clauses  <code>val pattern_1' -&gt; expr_1'</code> ... <code>val pattern_n' -&gt; expr_n'</code> handle the case where no exception is raised; in this case the value of <code>expr</code> is matched against <code>pattern_1'</code> ... <code>pattern_n'</code> to select the expression to evaluate to produce the result value.  (The actual syntax is implemented slightly more permissively: it allows value-matching and exception-matching clauses to be freely interleaved.)</p>

<p>Using handler case we can rewrite <code>iter_stream</code> to remove the extraneous option value:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">rec</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="k">try</span> <span class="nn">MyStream</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">s</span>
  <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nc">End_of_stream</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
                      <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We don't need to look far to find other code that benefits from the new construct.  Here's a function from the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/6a296a02/otherlibs/num/big_int.ml#L323-L328">Big_int</a> module in the standard library: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">int_of_big_int</span> <span class="n">bi</span> <span class="o">=</span>

    <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">failwith</span> <span class="s2">"int_of_big_int"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The core of the function --- the call to <code>int_of_nat</code> --- is rather buried in the complex control flow.  There are two <code>if</code>-<code>then</code>-<code>else</code> constructs, a <code>let</code> binding, and a <code>try</code> expression with a complex body.  Using handler case we can disentangle the code to make the four possible outcomes from the call to <code>int_of_nat</code> explicit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">int_of_big_int</span> <span class="n">bi</span> <span class="o">=</span>

     <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">n</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
     <span class="n">n</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Failure</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="k">when</span> <span class="n">eq_big_int</span> <span class="n">bi</span> <span class="n">monster_big_int</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
     <span class="n">monster_int</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Failure</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
     <span class="n">failwith</span> <span class="s2">"int_of_big_int"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here's a simpler example from <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/6a296a02/stdlib/string.ml#L195">the String module</a>, which also involves code that cannot raise an exception in the body of a <code>try</code> block:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">ignore</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">index_rec</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">l</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="bp">true</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nc">Not_found</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">false</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using handler case we can separate the code that may raise an exception (the call to <code>index_rec</code>) from the expression that produces the result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">index_rec</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">l</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">true</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Not_found</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">false</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Trying it out</h3>

<p>Using <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/">opam</a> you can install an OCaml compiler extended with handler case as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ opam remote add ocamllabs git@github.com:ocamllabs/opam-repo-dev.git
ocamllabs Fetching git@github.com:ocamllabs/opam-repo-dev.git

$ opam switch 4.02.0dev+handler-syntax
# To complete the configuration of OPAM, you need to run:

<p>You can also try out the handler case construct in your browser, using the following modified version of <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/">OCamlPro</a>'s <a href="http://try.ocamlpro.com/">Try OCaml</a> application:</p>

<h3>The discoveries of success continuations</h3>

<p>As <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler">Philip Wadler</a> <a href="http://wadler.blogspot.co.uk/2008/02/great-minds-think-alike.html">notes</a>, constructs for handling success continuations have been independently discovered multiple times.  In fact, the history goes back even further than described in Wadler's blog; constructs like handler case date back over thirty years and have been introduced, apparently independently, into at least four languages.  Curiously, all the languages use <code>let</code>-binding for success continuations and <code>match</code> binding for failure continuations.</p>

<h4>Lisp</h4>

<p>In <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/">Common Lisp</a> the construct analogous to <code>try</code> is <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_hand_1.htm"><code>handler-case</code></a> (from which the construct discussed here borrows its name).  A <code>handler-case</code> expression has a body and a sequence of clauses which specify how various conditions (exceptions) should be handled.  The special condition specification <code>:no-error</code> specifies the code to run when no condition is signalled.  The <code>iter_stream</code> function might be written as follows in Common Lisp:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-common-lisp" data-lang="common-lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">iter-stream</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">f</span> <span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">handler-case</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">get-stream</span> <span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">end-of-stream</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">_</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:no-error</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">|s'|</span><span class="p">)</span>
         <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">funcall</span> <span class="nv">f</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
         <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">iter-stream</span> <span class="nv">f</span> <span class="nv">|s'|</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Common Lisp specification was completed in 1994 but the <code>handler-case</code> construct and its <code>:no-error</code> clause were present in some of Common Lisp's progenitors.  The construct was apparently introduced to Symbolics Lisp some time around 1982: it appears in the <a href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/mit/cadr/chinual_5thEd_Jan83/chinualJan83_27_Errors.pdf">5th edition</a> of the Lisp Machine manual (January 1983) but not the <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/mit/cadr/chinual_4thEd_Jul81.pdf">4th edition</a> from 18 months earlier (July 1981).</p>

<h4>Python</h4>

<p>Python has supported success continuations in exception handlers since May 1994, when the <code>else</code> clause was added to <code>try</code> blocks.  The <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/36214c861144/Grammar/Grammar#l9">Changelog in old versions of the Grammar/Grammar file</a> has an entry</p>

<blockquote><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"># 3-May-94:
#Added else clause to try-except
</code></pre></div></blockquote>

<p>introduced in a <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/6c0e11b94009">commit from August 1994</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">changeset:   1744:6c0e11b94009

</code></pre></div></blockquote>

<p>Unlike the <code>:no-error</code> clause in Lisp's <code>handler-case</code>, Python's <code>else</code> clause doesn't bind variables.  Since Python variables have function scope, not block scope, bindings in the body of the try block are visible throughout the function.  In Python we might write <code>iter_stream</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">iter_stream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s_</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyStream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">End_of_stream</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="k">pass</span>
   <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="n">iter_stream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s_</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The provenance of the <code>else</code> clause is unclear, but it doesn't seem to derive from Lisp's <code>handler-case</code>.  The design of Python's exception handling constructs <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place">comes from Modula-3</a>, but the exception handling construct described in the <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-52.pdf">Modula-3 report</a> does not include a way of specifying the success continuation.  The syntax of the Modula-3 <code>TRY</code>/<code>EXCEPT</code> statement (found on p21 of the report) does include an <code>ELSE</code> clause:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">   TRY    
     Body
   EXCEPT
     id1 (v1) =&gt; Handler1
   | ...
   | idn (vn) =&gt; Handlern
   ELSE Handler0
   END
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, whereas Python's <code>else</code> handles the case where no exception is raised, Modula-3's <code>ELSE</code> handles the case where an exception not named in one of the <code>EXCEPT</code> clauses is raised: it is equivalent to Python's catch-all <code>except:</code>.</p>

<p>Python also adds success handlers to other constructs.  Both the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement"><code>for</code></a> and the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement"><code>while</code></a> statements have an optional <code>else</code> clause which is executed unless the loop terminates prematurely with an exception or <code>break</code>.</p>

<h4>Exceptional Syntax</h4>

<p>The 2001 paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/sml/exceptionalsyntax.pdf">Exceptional Syntax</a> (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/">Benton</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/">Kennedy</a>) proposed the following construct for handling exceptions in Standard ML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">pattern_1</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">expr_1</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">pattern_n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">expr_n</span>
 <span class="k">in</span>
    <span class="n">expr</span>
<span class="n">unless</span>
    <span class="n">pattern_1'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_1'</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">pattern_n'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_n'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Evaluation of the <code>let</code> binding proceeds as normal, except that if any of <code>expr_1</code> to <code>expr_n</code> raises an exception, control is transferred to the right hand side of the first of the clauses after <code>unless</code> whose left hand side matches the exception.  The construct is largely similar to our proposed variation, except that the bindings used in the success continuation are based on <code>let</code>, so scrutinising the values requires a separate <code>case</code> (i.e. <code>match</code>) expression.</p>

<p>Using the Exceptional Syntax construct we might write <code>iter_stream</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span>
 <span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="nn">MyStream</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="k">in</span>
     <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
     <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s'</span>
 <span class="n">unless</span> <span class="nc">End_of_stream</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
 <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Exceptional Syntax has been implemented in the SML-to-Java compiler <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mlj/">MLj</a>.</p>

<h4>Erlang</h4>

<p>The 2004 paper <a href="http://erlang.se/workshop/2004/exception.pdf">Erlang's Exception Handling Revisited</a> (Richard Carlsson, Bj&#246;rn Gustavsson and Patrik Nyblom) proposed an exception-handling construct for Erlang along the same lines as exceptional syntax, although apparently developed independently.  In the proposed extension to Erlang we might write <code>iter_stream</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erlang" data-lang="erlang"><span class="nf">iter_stream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">F</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">S</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
   <span class="k">try</span> <span class="nv">Mystream</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">S</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">of</span>
      <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">X</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">S_</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">F</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">X</span><span class="p">),</span>
        <span class="n">iter_stream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">F</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">S_</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="n">with</span>
    <span class="nv">End_of_stream</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Eff</h4>

<p><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/">Plotkin</a> and <a href="http://matija.pretnar.info/">Pretnar</a>'s work on <a href="http://matija.pretnar.info/pdf/handling-algebraic-effects.pdf">handlers for algebraic effects</a> generalises Exceptional Syntax to support effects other than exceptions.  The programming language <a href="http://math.andrej.com/eff/">eff</a> implements a design based on this work, and supports Exceptional Syntax, again with <code>let</code> binding for the success continuation.  (Although the success continuation is incorporated into the exception matching construct, only a single success continuation pattern is allowed.)  In eff we might write <code>iter_stream</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">rec</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="n">handle</span> <span class="n">my_stream_get</span> <span class="n">s</span>
  <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">exn</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">end_of_stream</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
                      <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The second argument in the <code>end_of_stream</code> clauses binds the continuation of the effect, allowing handling strategies other than the usual stack unwinding.  Since we ignore the continuation argument the behaviour is the same as for a regular exception handler.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matijapretnar/eff/blob/2a9a36cc/src/parser.mly#L4-L7">eff implementation</a> uses the term "handler case" for the clauses of the <code>handle</code> construct.</p>

<h4>OCaml</h4>

<p>Several OCaml programmers have proposed or implemented constructs related to handler case.</p>

<p><a name="delimcc"></a>
Oleg's <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html">delimcc</a> library for delimited continuations provides the operations needed to support the success continuation style.  The programmer can use <code>push_prompt</code> to establish a context, then call <code>shift</code> or <code>shift0</code> to return control to that context later, much as <code>try</code> establishes a context to which <code>raise</code> can transfer control.  If <code>shift</code> is not called then control returns normally from the continuation argument to <code>push_prompt</code>.  Using delimcc we might implement <code>iter_stream</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">rec</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">new_prompt</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="k">in</span>
    <span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">push_prompt</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">Val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">my_stream_get</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="k">with</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">Val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s'</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">End_of_stream</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://mjambon.com/">Martin Jambon</a> has <a href="http://mjambon.com/mikmatch-manual.html#htoc16">implemented</a> a construct equivalent to Exceptional Syntax for OCaml as part of the <a href="http://mjambon.com/micmatch.html">micmatch extension</a>.  His implementation allows us to write <code>iter_stream</code> in much the same way as Benton and Kennedy's proposal:</p>

<p>The details of the implementation are discussed in <a href="https://twitter.com/jakedonham">Jake Donham</a>'s <a href="http://ambassadortothecomputers.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/reading-camlp4-part-11-syntax.html">articles on Camlp4</a>.  The micmatch implementation has a novel feature: the <code>let</code> binding associated with the success continuation may be made recursive.</p>

<p><a href="http://alain.frisch.fr/">Alain Frisch</a> has proposed and implemented a more powerful extension to OCaml, <a href="http://www.lexifi.com/blog/static-exceptions">Static Exceptions</a>, which allow transfer of control to lexically-visible handlers (along the lines of Common Lisp's <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/s_block.htm#block"><code>block</code></a> and <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/s_ret_fr.htm#return-from"><code>return-from</code></a>).  Static exceptions are based on an equivalent feature in OCaml's intermediate language.</p>

<p>There is a straightforward translation from OCaml extended with handler case into OCaml extended with static exceptions by wrapping the body of each <code>try</code> expression in <code>raise (`Val (...))</code>, and changing the <code>val</code> keyword in the binding section to <code>`Val</code>.  For example, <code>iter_stream</code> can be written using static exceptions as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">rec</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="k">try</span> <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="o">(`</span><span class="nc">Val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nn">MyStream</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">))</span>
  <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nc">End_of_stream</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">Val</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
                       <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, static exceptions allow many other programs to be expressed that are not readily expressible using handler case.</p>

<p><a name="catch-me"></a>
In their 2008 paper <a href="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/David.Teller/publications/ml2008.pdf">Catch me if you can: Towards type-safe, hierarchical, lightweight, polymorphic and efficient error management in OCaml</a> David Teller Arnaud Spiwack and Till Varoquaux added an <code>attempt</code> keyword to OCaml that extends <code>match</code>-style pattern matching with both a single optional value case and an optional <code>finally</code> clause.</p>

<p>Finally, I discovered while writing this article that Christophe Raffalli proposed the handler case design fifteen years ago in a <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/1999/12/a6d3ce9671b16a33530035c2b42df011.en.html">message to caml-list</a>!  Christophe's proposal wasn't picked up back then, but perhaps the time has now come to give OCaml programmers a way to handle success.</p>

<p><a name="match-exception"></a></p>

<h3>Postscript: a symmetric extension</h3>

<p>The <code>try</code> construct in current OCaml supports matching against raised exceptions but not against the value produced when no exception is raised.  Contrariwise, the <code>match</code> construct supports matching against the value produced when no exception is raised, but does not support matching against raised exceptions.  As implemented, the patch addresses this asymmetry, extending <code>match</code> with clauses that specify the "failure continuation":</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">expr</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">pattern_1</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_1</span>
   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">...</span>
   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">pattern_n</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_n</span>
   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">exception</span> <span class="n">pattern_1'</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_1'</span>
   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">...</span>
   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">exception</span> <span class="n">pattern_n'</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">expr_n'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With this additional extension the choice between <code>match</code> and <code>try</code> becomes purely stylistic.  We might optimise for succinctness, and use <code>try</code> in the case where exceptions are expected (for example, where they're used for control flow), reserving <code>match</code> for the case where exceptions are truly exceptional.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, here's <code>iter_stream</code> written with the extended <code>match</code> construct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">rec</span> <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="k">match</span> <span class="nn">MyStream</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="k">with</span>
     <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
                <span class="n">iter_stream</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">s'</span>
   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">exception</span> <span class="nc">End_of_stream</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Since both <code>val</code> and <code>exception</code> are existing keywords, the extensions to both <code>try</code> and <code>match</code> are fully backwards compatible. </p>

<p>( This post is part of a series in which I am
<a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/06/09/choosing-a-python-replacement-for-0install">converting 0install from Python to OCaml</a>, learning OCaml as I go. The code is at <a href="https://github.com/0install/0install">GitHub/0install</a>. )</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone back through the Git commit log and selected all the ones that say they fix a bug in the comment, starting from when I merged the initial OCaml code to master (on 2013-07-03). It&#8217;s possible that I sneakily fixed some bugs while making other changes, but this should cover most of them. Any bug that made it into a released version of 0install should certainly have its own commit because it would have to go on the release branch. I also included a few &#8220;near misses&#8221; (bugs I spotted before committing, but which I could plausibly have missed).</p>

<p>In a number of cases, I wrote and committed the new OCaml code first, and then ported the Python unit-tests in a later commit and discovered the bug that way (so some of these could never have made it into an actual release). Compile-time bugs have been ignored (e.g. code that didn&#8217;t compile on older versions of OCaml); I&#8217;m only interested in run-time errors here.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve classified each bug as follows:</p>

<dl>  <dt>Inexperience</dt>
  <dd>This bug was caused by my inexperience with OCaml. Making proper use of OCaml&#8217;s features would avoid this class of bug entirely.</dd>
  <dt>Third-party</dt>
  <dd>Caused by a bug in a library I was using (and hopefully now fixed). Could only have been discovered by testing.</dd>
  <dt>Poor API</dt>
  <dd>This bug was my fault, but could have been avoided if the library had a better API.</dd>
  <dt>Warning needed</dt>
  <dd>My fault, but the compiler could have detected the problem and issued a warning.</dd>
  <dt>Testing only</dt>
  <dd>I only know how to find such bugs through testing. Similar bugs could happen again.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Core OCaml issues</h2>

<p>Note: I&#8217;m grouping the bugs by the library the code was interacting with, regardless of whether that library was at fault. This section is for bugs that occurred when just using OCaml itself and its standard library.</p>

<h3>Out-of-range integers</h3>

<p>Everything seemed to be working nicely on my Arch system, but the first run on a Debian VM gave this unhelpful error:</p>

<pre><code>Failure "int_of_string"
</code></pre>

<p>I was trying to store a Unix timestamp in an <code>int</code>. Unlike Python, OCaml&#8217;s integers are limited precision, having 1 bit less than the machine word size. The 32-bit VM only had 31-bit integers and the time value was out of range for it.</p>

<p>This was entirely my fault. OCaml always uses floats to represent times, and they work fine. I was just converting to ints to be consistent with the Python code.</p>

<p>However, the error message is very poor. I replaced all calls to <code>int_of_string</code> with my own version, which at least displays the number it was trying to convert. This should make debugging any similar problems easier in future.</p>

<p>Type: Inexperience</p>

<h3>Fails to start on Windows</h3>

<p>Windows kept complaining that my program didn&#8217;t exist and to check that the path was correct, even when I was double-clicking on the executable in Explorer!
Turns out, Windows refuses to run binaries with certain character sequences in their names (&#8220;instal&#8221; being one such sequence). See <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/windowssecurity/thread/73f86e9e-928f-40b7-8dd5-27e40db6997e/">Vista doesn&#8217;t start application called &#8220;install&#8221; w/o being elevated</a>.</p>

<p>Solution: you have to embed an XML &#8220;manifest&#8221; in Windows binaries to avoid this behaviour. Would be nice if OCaml did that automatically for you.</p>

<p>Type: Third-party</p>

<h3>Spawning a daemon fails on Windows</h3>

<p>Windows doesn&#8217;t have <code>fork</code>, so the usual double-fork trick doesn&#8217;t work.
Solution: Use <code>create_process</code> on Windows.</p>

<p>Would be nice if OCaml grouped all the POSIX-only functions together and made you check which platform you were on. Then you&#8217;d know when you were using platform-specific functions. e.g.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>0install select ignores <code>--refresh</code></h3>

<p>I forget to handle the <code>Refresh</code> case for the &#8220;select&#8221; command.
Different commands need to handle different subsets of the options. I was using a plain variant (enum) type and throwing an exception if I got an option I wasn&#8217;t expecting:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="nn">Support</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nn">Argparse</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter_options</span> <span class="n">extra_options</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">function</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">ShowXML</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">select_opts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">xml</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="bp">true</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">raise_safe</span> <span class="s2">"Unknown option"</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>(Note: Several people have asked why I used a default match case here. It&#8217;s needed because there are many options that don&#8217;t apply to the &#8220;select&#8221; command. The option parser makes sure that each sub-command&#8217;s handler function is only called with options it claims to support.)</p>

<p>Solution: I switched from plain variants to polymorphic variants and removed the default case. Now, the type-checker verifies at compile-time that each subcommand handles all its options:</p>

<h3>Not found errors</h3>

<p>When printing diagnostics about a failed solve, we check each interface to see if it has a replacement that it conflicts with. e.g. the new &#8220;Java&#8221; interface replaces (and conflicts with) the old &#8220;Java 6&#8221; interface. But if the conflicting interface wasn&#8217;t used in the solve, we&#8217;d crash with:</p>

<pre><code>Exception: Not_found
</code></pre>

<p>I use a lot of maps with strings as the keys. I therefore created a <code>StringMap</code> module in my <code>common.ml</code> file like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nc">StringMap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Map</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Make</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p><code>StringMap.find</code> raises <code>Not_found</code> if the key isn&#8217;t found, which is never what you want. These exceptions are awkward to deal with and it&#8217;s easy to forget to handle them.</p>

<p>A nice solution is to replace the definition with:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nc">StringMap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">struct</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">include</span> <span class="nn">Map</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Make</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">find</span> <span class="n">key</span> <span class="n">map</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">try</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">find</span> <span class="n">key</span> <span class="n">map</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nc">Not_found</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">None</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This redefines the <code>find</code> method to return an option type. Now you can&#8217;t do a <code>StringMap.find</code> without the compiler forcing you to consider the case of the key not being there.</p>

<p>Would be nice if the OCaml standard library did this. Perhaps providing a <code>Map.get</code> function with the new behaviour and deprecating <code>Map.find</code>?</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>Octal value</h3>

<p>I used <code>0700</code> instead of <code>0o700</code> to set a file mode. Would be nice if OCaml warned about decimals that start with 0, as Python 3 does.</p>

<p>Type: Warning needed</p>

<h3>Parsing a path as a URL</h3>

<p>This didn&#8217;t actually get committed, but it&#8217;s interesting anyway. Downloaded feeds are signed with GPG keys, which are trusted only for their particular domains. At one point, I used <code>Trust.domain_from_url feed.url</code> to get the domain. It was defined as:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">domain_from_url</span> <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>However, feeds come in different types: there are remote feeds with URLs, and local feeds with local paths (there are also virtual &#8220;distribution&#8221; feeds representing the output from the distribution&#8217;s package manager).</p>

<p>I was trying to get the trust domain for all feeds, not just remote ones where it makes sense.</p>

<p>Once again, the solution was to use polymorphic variants. The three different types of feed get three different constructors. A method (such as <code>domain_from_url</code>) that only works on remote feeds is declared as:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">domain_from_url</span> <span class="o">(`</span><span class="n">remote_feed</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Then, it&#8217;s impossible to call it without first ensuring you&#8217;ve got a remote feed URL.</p>

<p>This change also improves the type-safety of many other parts of the code (e.g. you can&#8217;t try to download a local feed now either), and uncovered another bug: you couldn&#8217;t use the GUI to set the stability rating for a distribution-provided implementation, because one of the functions used only worked for non-distribution feeds.</p>

<p>Type: Inexperience (x2)</p>

<h3>Interrupted waitpid</h3>

<p>The <code>Unix.waitpid</code> function can raise <code>EINTR</code> if the system call is interrupted, although the documentation doesn&#8217;t mention this. It would be nice if OCaml would automatically restart the call in this case (as Python&#8217;s <code>subprocess</code> module does).</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>HTTP redirects with data cause corrupted downloads</h3>

<p>We download to a temporary file. If we get an HTTP redirect, we truncate the file and try the new address. However, <code>ftruncate</code> doesn&#8217;t reset the position in the file. So, if the redirecting site sent any data in its reply, you&#8217;d get that many zeroes at the start of the download. As with <code>waitpid</code>, OCaml&#8217;s behaviour is standard POSIX, but not mentioned in the OCaml documentation.</p>

<p>Solution: <code>seek_out ch 0</code>.</p>

<p>Also, I updated the test server used in the unit-tests to send back some data when doing a redirect.</p>

<p>Type: Testing only</p>

<h3>Setting wrong mtime</h3>

<p><code>Unix.utimes</code> is supposed to set the mtime and atime of a file to the given values. However, the behaviour is a little odd:</p>

<ul>  <li>When 1 &lt;= time &lt; infinity, it sets it to the requested time.</li>
  <li>When 0 &lt;= time &lt; 1 however, it sets it to the current time instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s a problem for us, because we often use &#8220;0&#8221; as the time for files which don&#8217;t have a timestamp, and the time is part of the secure hashes we calculate.</p>

<p>Solution: I wrote a C function to allow setting the time to whatever value you like.</p>

<p>This bug didn&#8217;t make it into a commit because I hit it while writing a test script (I was trying to reset a timestamp file to time zero), and the unit-tests would have caught it if not, but it&#8217;s still a poor API. Not only does it fail to use a variant type to handle different cases, but it chooses a magic value that&#8217;s a valid input!</p>

<p>Or, rather than using a variant type for these two cases, it could just drop the magic current time feature completely - it&#8217;s easy enough to read the current time and pass it explicitly if you need it. That would make the code clearer too.</p>

<p>(note: the documentation does say &#8220;A time of 0.0 is interpreted as the current time&#8221;, but it&#8217;s easy to forget this if it wasn&#8217;t relevant the first time you read the docs)</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>Strict sequences</h3>

<p>This didn&#8217;t make it into a commit, but it&#8217;s interesting anyway. Simplified version of the problem:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">trace</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">print_endline</span> <span class="s2">"START"</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="bp">()</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">print_endline</span> <span class="s2">"END"</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">trace</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Printf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">printf</span> <span class="s2">"Hello %s!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>START
END
</code></pre>

<p>Why is there no warning? You might expect OCaml would infer the type of <code>fn</code> as <code>unit -&gt; unit</code> and then complain that the function we pass has the wrong type (<code>unit -&gt; string -&gt; unit</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, although OCaml warns if you ignore the result of a function that doesn&#8217;t return unit, it&#8217;s not actually an error. So it actually infers the type of <code>fn</code> as (<code>unit -&gt; 'a</code>), and it compiles fine.</p>

<p>Solution: always compile with <code>-strict-sequence</code> (or put <code>true: strict_sequence</code> in your <code>_tags</code> file)</p>

<h2>Lwt-related bugs</h2>

<h3>Lwt process fails with empty string</h3>

<p>When spawning a process, the Lwt docs say you can pass an empty string as the binary to run and it will search for the first argument in <code>$PATH</code> for you. However, that behaviour was added only in Lwt 2.4 and using the older version in Debian it failed at runtime with a confusing error.</p>

<p>Probably I should have been reading the old version of the docs (which the web-site helpfully lets you do).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m classifying this as a poor API because it was caused by using <code>""</code> as a magic value, rather than defining a new constructor function.</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>EPIPE on Windows</h3>

<p>On Windows, we couldn&#8217;t read the output of GnuPG. This was due to a bug in Lwt, which they quickly fixed:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/20">Lwt_io.read fails on Windows with EPIPE</a></p>

<p>Type: Third-party</p>

<h3>Deleting temporary files</h3>

<p>We download various files to a temporary directory. In some cases, they weren&#8217;t being deleted afterwards.</p>

<p>Solution: the downloader now takes a mandatory Lwt switch and deletes the file when the switch is turned off. Callers just have to wrap the download call in a <code>try ... finally</code> block, like this:</p>

<p>To make this completely foolproof, you&#8217;d need something like the linear types from Rust or ATS, but this is good enough for me.</p>

<h3>Race shutting down test HTTP server</h3>

<p>Some of the unit tests run a simple HTTP server. When the test is over, they use <code>Lwt.cancel</code> to kill it. However, it appears that this call is unreliable: depending on exactly what the server is doing at the time it might just ignore it and continue.</p>

<p>Solution: we both cancel the task <em>and</em> set a boolean flag, which we test just before calling <code>accept</code>. If we&#8217;re in <code>accept</code> at the time of the cancel, the thread will abort correctly. If it&#8217;s anywhere else, it may continue handling the current request, but will quit as soon as it finishes and checks the flag.</p>

<p>Would perhaps be nice if Lwt remembered that an attempt was made to cancel the thread during a non-cancellable operation, and killed it at the next opportunity.</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<p>A related race occurred if we spawned a child process while handling an HTTP request, because the child would inherit the client socket and it would never get closed.</p>

<p>Solution: Use <code>Lwt_unix.set_close_on_exec connection</code> as soon as the connection is accepted.</p>

<p>Note that both these hacks should be race-free, because Lwt is cooperatively multi-threaded (e.g. we can&#8217;t spawn a subprocess between accepting a connection and marking it <code>close_on_exec</code>). I think.</p>

<p>Ideally, when spawning a child process you&#8217;d specify the file descriptors you wanted it to inherit explicitly (Go does this, but really it needs to be at the POSIX level).</p>

<p>Type: Testing only</p>

<p>(although these bugs only occurred in the unit-tests, I&#8217;m including them because they could just as easily appear in the main code)</p>

<h3>Reactive event handler gets garbage collected</h3>

<p>The OCaml D-BUS bindings use <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/react/doc/React">functional reactive programming</a> to report property values.
The idea is that you get an object representing the continuously-varying value of the property, rather than a particular sample of it.
Then you can handle the signal as a whole (for example, you can get the &#8220;progress&#8221; signal from a PackageKit transaction and pass it to a GUI progress monitor widget, so that the widget always shows the current progress).
You can build up chains of signal processors. For example, you might transform a &#8220;bytes downloaded&#8221; signal into a &#8220;percentage complete&#8221; one.</p>

<p>The technique seems to come from Haskell. Being purely functional, it&#8217;s always safe to garbage collect a signal if no-one is holding a reference to it.</p>

<p>However, OCaml is not purely functional. You might easily want to evaluate a signal handler for its side-effects.
I created a handler to monitor the transaction status signal to see when it was finished, and attached the resulting signal to a <code>Lwt_switch</code>.
My plan was that the switch would keep it alive until it fired.
That didn&#8217;t work, because there was a subtle circular reference in the whole scheme, and OCaml would sometimes garbage-collect the handler and the switch. Then the process would ignore the finished event and appear to hang. I asked on StackOverflow and got some suggestions:</p>

<ul>  <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19975140/how-to-stop-ocaml-garbage-collecting-my-reactive-event-handler">How to stop OCaml garbage collecting my reactive event handler?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The solution seems to be to keep references to all active signals in a global variable. Rather messy.</p>

<h3>Stuck reading output from subprocess</h3>

<p>When using the <code>Lwt_glib</code> module to integrate with the GTK mainloop, the <code>HUP</code> response from <code>poll</code> is ignored. This means that it will call <code>poll</code> endlessly in a tight loop.

<p>Type: Third-party</p>

<h3>Downloads never complete</h3>

<p>When using <code>Lwt_glib</code>, downloads may never complete. This is because OCaml, like Python, has a global lock and <code>Lwt_glib</code> fails to release it when calling <code>poll</code>. Therefore, no other thread (such as the download thread) can make progress while the main thread is waiting (e.g. for the download thread to finish).

<h3>Event loop doesn&#8217;t work on OS X</h3>

<p><code>Lwt_glib</code> passes <code>-1000</code> to <code>poll</code> to mean &#8220;no timeout&#8221;. This works on Linux, but not on BSD-type systems.

<h2>Curl-related bugs</h2>

<h3>Failing to reset Curl connections</h3>

<p>For efficiency, Curl encourages the reuse of connections. However, I forgot to reset some parameters (max file size and expected modification time). If the next call didn&#8217;t use them, it would reuse the old values and possibly fail.</p>

<p>Newer versions of ocurl have a <code>reset</code> function, which avoids these problems.</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>Error with cancelled downloads</h3>

<p>Downloads were sometimes failing with this confusing error:</p>

<pre><code>easy handled already used in multi handle
</code></pre>

<p>It happened when reusing connections (which Curl encourages, for efficiency).
There was no direct way to cancel a download, so I handled cancellation by closing the channel the download was writing to.
Then, next time some data arrived, my write callback would fail to write the new data and throw an exception, aborting the download.
It turned out that this was leaving the connection in an invalid state.</p>

<p>Solution: return 0 from the handler instead of throwing an exception.</p>

<p>Ideally, ocurl should catch exceptions from callbacks and allow the C code to clean up properly. <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=ocurl/ocurl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=813e4254cab1c5f1cc806f9aa537c6deff61466f">Now fixed</a>.</p>

<h2>GTK bugs</h2>

<h3>Sorted treeview iter mix-up</h3>

<p>(I caught this before committing it, but it&#8217;s a nasty bug that could easily be missed. It was present for a while in the original Python version.)</p>

<p>The cache explorer dialog allows you to delete implementations from the cache by selecting an item and pressing the Delete button.
It also allows you to sort the table by clicking on the column headings.
However, if you sort the table and then delete something, it deletes the wrong thing!</p>

<p>To make a sortable table (which is just a special case of a tree to GTK), you first create an underlying (unsorted) list model, then wrap it with a sorted model, then pass that to the display widget (GtkTreeView), like so:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">GTree</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">list_store</span> <span class="n">cols</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">sorted_model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">GTree</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">model_sort</span> <span class="n">model</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">view</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">GTree</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">view</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">sorted_model</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>To do things with the model, you pass it a GtkTreeIter, which says which item you want to act on, e.g.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">remove</span> <span class="n">iter</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The trouble is, sorted and unsorted GtkTreeIters both have the same type, so you can easily pass an iterator of the sorted model as an argument to the unsorted model.
Then it will act on the wrong item.
If the view isn&#8217;t sorted then everything works fine, so you might not notice the problem while testing.</p>

<p>Solution: I created a new module for unsorted lists. The implementation (<code>unsorted_list.ml</code>) just proxies calls to the real code:</p>

<p>However, the interface (<code>unsorted_list.mli</code>) makes the types <code>t</code> (the model) and <code>iter</code> (its <code>GtkTreeIter</code>s) abstract, so that code outside of the module isn&#8217;t allowed to know their real types:</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s impossible to mix up sorted and unsorted types:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It&#8217;s still possible to mix up iterators in some cases (e.g. between two different instances of a sorted model), but that&#8217;s a much less likely mistake to make.</p>

<p>Another way to solve the problem would be to bundle the owning model with each iterator, but that would be a big change to how the underlying GTK library works.
And ATS could solve this easily using its dependant types, by declaring the iterator type as <code>iter(m)</code> (&#8220;iterator of model at address m&#8221;), linking models to iterators in the type system.</p>

<p>Type: Poor API</p>

<h3>Crashes with GtkIconView</h3>

<p>As with GtkTreeView, you can make a sorted GtkIconView with a pair of models.
For some reason, clearing the underlying model didn&#8217;t clear the sorted version, and repopulating it corrupted memory:</p>

<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
</code></pre>

<p>Solution: since there is no UI to let the user change the sort column, I just removed the sorted model and sorted the underlying model myself in OCaml. I guess this is probably a GTK bug.</p>

<p>Type: Third-party</p>

<p>A second crashing bug with GtkIconView is caused by a bug in lablgtk.
The C wrapper <code>get_path_at_pos</code> returns a <code>tree_path option</code> (<code>None</code> if you clicked in a blank area), but the OCaml declaration says it returns a plain <code>tree_path</code>.</p>

<p>Solution: use <code>Obj.magic</code> to do an unchecked cast to the correct type:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>(reported as <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1359&amp;group_id=220&amp;atid=1032">segfault due to GtkIconView type mismatch</a>)</p>

<p>Two interesting things about this bug:</p>

<ol>  <li>Even the low-level GTK bindings are presumably not generated automatically. If they were, this kind of mismatch surely couldn&#8217;t happen.</li>
  <li>An OCaml optional pointer doesn&#8217;t have the same representation as a non-optional pointer. If it did, the code wouldn&#8217;t crash. This suggests OCaml is being a bit inefficient about option types, which is disappointing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Type: Third-party</p>

<h2>Logic errors</h2>

<p>The remaining bugs aren&#8217;t very interesting, but I&#8217;ve included them for completeness:</p>

<ul>  <li>Failed to handle ambiguous short options (e.g. <code>-r</code>)</li>
  <li>Missing tab completion for <code>0install add</code></li>
  <li><code>0install run</code> ignores <code>--gui</code> option</li>
  <li>Infinite loop handling recursive dependencies</li>
  <li>Allow absolute local paths in local implementations</li>
  <li>Default command for <code>--source</code> should be <code>compile</code>, not <code>run</code></li>
  <li>Allow <code>machine:null</code> in JSON response</li>
  <li>Typo: scripts start <code>#!</code> not <code>!#</code></li>
  <li>Report an error if we need to confirm keys during a headless background update</li>
  <li>Wrong attribute name in overrides XML file</li>
  <li>Allow executing selections with no command but an absolute main</li>
  <li>Handle local-path on <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> elements</li>
  <li>Wrong attribute name when saving user overrides</li>
  <li>Typo: <code>"https://"</code> not <code>"https://'"</code></li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t try to use GUI in <code>--dry-run</code> mode</li>
  <li>Support old version of selections XML format</li>
  <li>Support old selections without a <code>from-feed</code> attribute</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t send an empty GetDetails request to PackageKit</li>
  <li>Cope with dpkg-query returning a non-zero exit status</li>
  <li>Detect Python even if python-gobject is missing</li>
  <li>Race when cancelling downloads</li>
</ul>

<p>Type: Testing only (x21)</p>

<h2>Python bugs</h2>

<p>Just for interest, here are the Python bugs discovered over the same period (it doesn&#8217;t make sense to compare bug counts, because these are bugs in mature code, often several years old, not just-written new code).</p>

<p>I think these would be impossible or unlikely in OCaml (the problem would be detected at compile time):</p>

<ul>  <li>Error setting machine type for Cygwin packages (type error)</li>
  <li>When loading selections from a file, convert <code>last-check-mtime</code> attribute to an int (type error)</li>
  <li><code>UnicodeError</code> extracting or generating a manifest for archives with non-ASCII file names (no encoding of file names in OCaml :-)</li>
  <li>Crash when specifying bold text (PyGTK API change)</li>
  <li>Broken clipboard handling in cache explorer (PyGTK API change)</li>
  <li>Broken filtering in cache explorer (PyGTK API change)</li>
  <li>Broken cache explorer menu when using a filter (model mix up; could avoid with abstract types, as above)</li>
  <li>Fails running an app when the master feed is no longer cached (would be forced to handle None case in OCaml)</li>
</ul>

<p>These would likely still be bugs in OCaml:</p>

<ul>  <li>Fix mtime check in <code>selections.get_unavailable_selections</code> for native packages</li>
  <li>Always return False for native packages in <code>needs_download</code> if <code>include_packages</code> is False</li>
  <li>Always use the prefix &#8220;xml&#8221; for the XML namespace</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t abort solving just because a local feed is missing</li>
  <li>Escape tooltips in cache explorer</li>
  <li>32-bit size limit in cache explorer</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a third-party bug:</p>

<ul>  <li>Workaround for PyGTK garbage collection bug</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Despite the newness of the code, the bug-rate has been surprisingly low so far. Of the (detected) bugs that did make it past the compiler, about a sixth were due to bugs in third-party libraries, another sixth could have been avoided with better third-party APIs and a sixth we due to my inexperience with OCaml. For the remaining half, more testing is still the only way I can see to find such bugs.</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/bugs.png" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a shame that OCaml seems to have no system for deprecating old APIs. This means that poor API choices made years ago are still causing trouble today. It would be good if OCaml could flag functions as being there for historical reasons only, and issue a compiler warning if you used them. I do, however, like the fact that they stay around - breaking existing code (as Python 3 did) is not the solution either!</p>

<p>Two of the bugs (&#8220;Deleting temporary files&#8221; and &#8220;Reactive event handler gets garbage collected&#8221;) could have been avoided if OCaml had linear types, but I have reasonable solutions to both. The XML / JSON handling bugs could have been avoided by using proper schemas, but such schemas didn&#8217;t exist (my fault).</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m pretty happy with the bug rate so far. No doubt more bugs will be discovered as the new code makes its way into the distributions and gains more users, but I think this code will be easier to maintain than the Python code, and much less likely to break silently due to changes in the language or third-party libraries.</p>

<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>At the start of 2013, OCaml was in the interesting position of being a mature
decades-old language with a small, loyal community of industrial users who built
mission critical applications using it.  We had the opportunity to sit down
with many of them at the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/">OCaml Consortium</a>
meeting and prioritise where we started work.  The answer came back clearly:
while the compiler itself is legendary for its stability, the tooling around it
(such as package management) was a pressing problem.</p>
<h4>OPAM</h4>
<p>Our solution to this tooling was centered around the
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a> package manager that
<a href="http://ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a> released into beta just at the end of 2012, and
had its first stable release in March 2013.  OPAM differs from most system
package managers by emphasising a flexible distributed workflow that uses
version constraints to ensure incompatible libraries aren't mixed up (important
for the statically-typed OCaml that is very careful about dependencies).
Working closely with <a href="http://ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a> we developed a git-based
workflow to make it possible for users (both individual or industrial) to
easily build up their own package repositories and redistribute OCaml code, and
started curating the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">package
repository</a>.</p>
<p>The results have been satisfying: we started with an initial set of around 100 packages in
OPAM (mostly imported by the 4 developers), and ended 2013 with 587 unique packages and 2000 individual versions, with contributions from 160 individuals.  We now have a curated
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">central package repository</a> for anyone
to submit their OCaml code,
several third-party remotes are maintained (e.g. the <a href="https://github.com/xapi-project/opam-repo-dev">Xen Project</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/opam-ocsigen">Ocsigen</a>).  We also regularly
receive releases of the <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com">Core</a> libraries
from Jane Street, and updates from sources as varied as <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/1300">Facebook</a>,
<a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/16/camlpdf-the-end-of-sucky-pdf-tools.html">Coherent PDF</a>,
to the <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/guha.pdf">Frenetic SDN</a> research.</p>
<p>A notable contribution from OCamlPro during this time was to
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/955">clarify</a> the licensing on
the package repository to be the liberal
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0</a>, and also to pass ownership to
the <a href="http://github.com/ocaml">OCaml</a> organization on GitHub, where it's now
jointly maintained by OCaml Labs, OCamlPro and anyone else that wishes to
contribute.</p>
<h4>A lens into global OCaml code</h4>
<p>It's been quite interesting just watching all the varied code fly into the
repository, but stability quickly became a concern as the new packages piled
up.  OCaml compiles to native code on not just x86, but also PowerPC, Sparc and
<a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2012/02/25/dreamplug-debian-and-ocaml.html">ARM</a> CPUs.
We kicked off various efforts into automated testing: firstly <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David Sheets</a>
built the
<a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/09/ocamlot-autotriaging.html">OCamlot</a> daemon
that would schedule builds across all the exotic hardware. Later in the year,
the <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> service launched support for testing from GitHub pull requests,
and this became the front line of <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html">automated
checking</a> for all
incoming new packages to OPAM.</p>
<p>A major headache with automated testing is usually setting up the right build
environment with external library dependencies, and so we <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/11/15/docker-and-opam.html">added Docker
support</a> to make it
easier to bulk-build packages for local developer use, with the results of
builds available <a href="https://github.com/avsm/opam-bulk-logs">publically</a> for
anyone to help triage.  Unfortunately fixing the bugs themselves is still a
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/1304">very manual process</a>, so
more volunteers are always welcome to help out!</p>
<p>We're going to be really seeing the rewards from all this effort as OCaml
4.02 development proceeds, since we can now adopt a data-driven approach
to changing language features instead of guessing how much third-party
code will break.  If your code is in OPAM, then it'll be tested as new
features such as <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6063">module aliases</a>,
<a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/garrigue.pdf">injectivity</a> and
<a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/white.pdf">extension points</a> show up.</p>
<h4>Better documentation</h4>
<p>The venerable
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual029.html">OCamlDoc</a> tool
has done an admirable job for the last decade, but is increasingly showing its
age due to a lack of support for cross-referencing across packages.  We started
working on this problem in the summer when <a href="https://github.com/vincent-botbol">Vincent Botbol</a>
visited us on an internship, expecting it to be a quick job to come up with
something as good as Haskell's excellent <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> online documentation.</p>
<p>Instead, we ran into the "module wall": since OCaml makes it so easy to
parameterise code over other modules, it makes it hard to generate static
documentation without outputting hundreds of megabytes of HTML every time.
After some hard work from Vincent and Leo, we've got a working prototype that
lets you simply run <code>opam install opam-doc &amp;&amp; opam doc core async</code> to generate
package documentation.  You can see the results for
<a href="http://mirage.github.io/">Mirage</a> online, but expect to see this integrated
into the main OCaml site for all OPAM packages as we work through polishing up
the user interface.</p>
<h4>Turning OPAM into libraries</h4>
<p>The other behind-the-scenes effort for OPAM has been to keep the core command-line
tool simple and stable, and to have it install OCaml libraries that can be
interfaced with by other tools to do domain-specific tasks.  <a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas Gazagnaire</a>,
<a href="http://louis.gesbert.fr/cv.en.html">Louis Gesbert</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David Sheets</a> have been steadily hacking away at this and
we now have <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/opamfu">opamfu</a> to run operations
over all packages, and an easy-to-template <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam2web">opam2web</a>
that generates the live <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">opam.ocaml.org</a> website.</p>
<p>This makes OPAM easier to deploy within other organizations that want to integrate
it into their workflow.  For example, the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/pkg/">software
section</a> of the OCaml Labs website is regularly
generated from a search of all OPAM packages tagged <code>ocamllabs</code>.  We also used
it to rewrite the entire OPAM repository <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/1240">in one epic diff</a> to add external
library dependencies via a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/886/files">command-line shim</a>.</p>
<h4>OPAM-in-a-Box</h4>
<p>All of this effort is geared towards making it easier to maintain reusable
local OPAM installations.  After several requests from big universities to help
out their teaching needs, we're putting together all the support needed to
easily redistribute OPAM packages via an
"<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1035">OPAM-in-a-Box</a>" command that uses
<a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a> containers to let you clone and do lightweight
modifications of OCaml installations.</p>
<p>This will also be useful for anyone who'd like to run tutorials or teach OCaml,
without having to rely on flaky network connectivity at conference venues: a problem we've  <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-review">suffered from</a> too!</p>
<h3>Core Compiler</h3>
<p>Starting to work on a real compiler can often be a daunting prospect, and so
one initiative we started this year is to host regular <a href="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/10/30/third-compiler-hacking-session.html">compiler hacking sessions</a> where people could find a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki">curated list of features</a> to work on, with the regular developers at hand to help out when people get stuck, and free beer and pizza to oil the coding wheels.  This has worked out well, with around 20 people showing up on average for the three we held, and <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-previously-worked-on">several patches</a> submitted upstream to OCaml.  <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/">Gabriel Scherer</a> and <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~doligez/">Damien Doligez</a> have been helping this effort by tagging <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/search.php?project_id=1&amp;sticky_issues=1&amp;sortby=last_updated&amp;dir=DESC&amp;highlight_changed=24&amp;hide_status_id=90&amp;tag_string=junior_job">junior jobs</a> in the OCaml Mantis bug tracker as they are filed.</p>
<h4>Syntax transformations and extension points</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo White</a> started the year fresh out of completing his PhD with <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/">Alan Mycroft</a>, and before he realized what he'd
gotten himelf into was working with <a href="http://alain.frisch.fr/">Alain Frisch</a> on the
future of syntax transformations in OCaml.  We started off our first
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/wg-camlp4">wg-camlp4</a> working group on the new
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">lists.ocaml.org</a> host, and a spirited discussion
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4/2013-January/thread.html">started</a> that
went <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4/2013-February/thread.html">on</a>
and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4/2013-March/thread.html">on</a> for
several months.  It ended with a very satisfying design for a simpler <em>extension
points</em> mechanism which Leo <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/white.pdf">presented</a>
at the OCaml 2013 workshop at ICFP, and is now merged into OCaml 4.02-trunk.</p>
<h4>Namespaces</h4>
<p>Not all of the working groups were quite as successful in coming to a conclusion as the Camlp4 one.  On the Platform mailing list, Gabriel Scherer started a discussion on the design for <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/platform/2013-February/000050.html">namespaces</a> in OCaml.  The resulting discussion was useful in separating multiple concerns that were intermingled in the initial proposal, and Leo wrote a <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/2013/03/10/ocaml-namespaces.html">comprehensive blog post</a> on a proposed namespace design.</p>
<p>After further discussion at <a href="http://icfpconference.org/icfp2013/">ICFP 2013</a> with Jacques Garrigue later in the year, it turns out adding support for <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6063">module aliases</a> would solve much of the cost associated with compiling large libraries such as <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com">Core</a>, with no backwards compatibility issues.  This solution has now been integrated into OCaml 4.02.0dev and is being tested with Core.</p>
<h4>Delving into the bug tracker</h4>
<p>Jeremy Yallop joined us in April, and he and Leo also leapt into the core
compiler and started triaging issues on the OCaml <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis">bug
tracker</a>.  This seems unglamorous in the
beginning, but there rapidly turned out to be many fascinating threads that
shed light on OCaml's design and implementation through seemingly harmless
bugs.  Here is a pick of some interesting threads through the year that we've
been involved with:</p>
<ul> <li>An <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5985&amp;nbn=49#bugnotes">unexpected interaction between variance and GADTs</a>
 that led to Jacques Garrigue's <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/garrigue.pdf">talk</a> at OCaml 2013.</li>
 <li>Type unsoundness by <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5992">pattern matching lazy mutable values</a>, thus
 shedding light on the precise semantics of the order of pattern matching.</li>
 <li>Leo proposed an <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5584">open types</a> extension
 to allow abstract types to be declared open. You can try it via <code>opam switch 4.00.1+open-types</code>.</li>
 <li>Designing the popular, but controversial <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5759">record disambiguation feature</a> in OCaml 4.01.0, and debating <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6000">the right warnings</a> needed to prevent programmer surprise.</li>
 <li>Exposing a <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6064">GADT representation for Bigarray</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a sample of some of the issues solved in Mantis; if you want to
learn more about OCaml, it's well worth browsing through it to learn from over
a decade of interesting discussions from all the developers.</p>
<h4>Thread-local storage runtime</h4>
<p>While OCamlPro was working on their <a href="https://github.com/lucasaiu/ocaml">reentrant OCaml runtime</a>, we took a different tack by adding <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml/tree/multicore">thread-local storage</a> to the runtime instead, courtesy of <a href="http://mu.netsoc.ie/">Stephen Dolan</a>.  This is an important choice to make at the outset of adding multicore, so both approaches are warranted.  The preemptive runtime adds a lot of code churn (due to adding a context parameter to most function calls) and takes up a register, whereas the thread-local storage approach we tried doesn't permit callbacks to different threads.</p>
<p>Much of this work isn't interesting on its own, but forms the basis for a fully multicore runtime (with associated programming model) in 2014. Stay tuned!</p>
<h4>Ctypes</h4>
<p>One other complaint from the Consortium members was quite surprising: the difficulty of using the OCaml foreign function interface safely to interface with C code.  Jeremy Yallop began working on the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes">ctypes</a> library that had the goal of eliminating the need to write any C code at all for the vast majority of foreign bindings.</p>
<p>Instead, Ctypes lets you describe any C function call as an OCaml value, and provides various linkage options to invoke that function into C.  The first option he implemented was a <code>dlopen</code> interface, which immediately brought us the same level of functionality as the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html">Python</a> or <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Library/libffi">Haskell</a> Ctypes equivalents.  This early code was in itself startlingly useful and more pleasant to use than the raw FFI, and various folk (such as David Sheets' <a href="https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-sodium">libsodium</a> cryptography bindings) started adopting it.</p>
<p>At this point, I happened to be struggling to write the Foreign Function Interface chapter of <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a> without blowing through our page budget with a comprehensive explanation of the existing system.  I decided to take a risk and write about Ctypes instead, since it let new users to the language have a <em>far</em> more productive experience to get started.  Xavier Leroy pointed out <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/book/issues/1701">some shortcomings</a> of the library in his technical book review, most notably with the lack of an interface with C.  The design of Ctypes fully supports alternate linking mechanisms than just <code>dlopen</code> though, and Jeremy has added automatic C stub generation support as well.  This means that if you use Ctypes to build an OCaml binding in 2014, you can choose several mechanisms for the same source code to link to the external system.  Jeremy even demonstrated a forking model at OCaml 2013 that protects the OCaml runtime from the C binding via process separation.</p>
<p>The effort is paying off: Daniel B&#252;nzli <a href="http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/2013.12.17.html#9">ported SDL2</a> using ctypes, and gave us extensive <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/issues">feedback</a> about any missing corner cases, and the resulting bindings don't require any C code to be written. <a href="http://xulforum.org">Jonathan Protzenko</a> even used it to implement an OCaml controlle
r for the <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/raspi-lcd/">Adafruit Raspberry Pi RGB LCD</a>!</p>
<h3>Community Efforts</h3>
<p>Our community efforts were largely online, but we also hosted visitors over the year and regular face-to-face tutorials.</p>
<h4>Online at OCaml.org</h4>
<p>While the rest of the crew were hacking on OPAM and OCaml, <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/">Amir Chaudhry</a> and <a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe Wang</a> teamed up with Ashish Agarwal and Christophe Troestler to redesign and relaunch the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml website</a>.  Historically, OCaml's homepage has been the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr">caml.inria.fr</a> domain, and the <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> effort was begun by Christophe and Ashish <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/caml-list@inria.fr/msg00169.html">some years ago</a> to modernize the web presence.</p>
<p>The webpages were already rather large with complex scripting (for example, the <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html">99 Problems</a> page runs the OCaml code to autogenerate the output). Philippe developed a <a href="https://github.com/pw374/MPP-language-blender">template DSL</a> that made it easier to unify a lot of the templates around the website, and also a <a href="https://github.com/pw374/omd">Markdown parser</a> that we could link to as a library from the rest of the infrastructure without shelling out to Pandoc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amir designed a series of <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">interactive wireframe sketches</a>  and <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/ocamlorg-request-for-feedback/">gathered feedback</a> on it from the community. A local design agency in Cambridge helped with visual look and feel, and finally at the end of the summer we began the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/migration-plan-ocaml-org/">migration</a> to the new website, followed by a triumphant <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">switchover</a> in November to the design you see today.</p>
<p>The domain isn't just limited to the website itself.  Leo and I set up a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-scripts">SVN-to-Git mirror</a> of the OCaml compiler <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/anonsvn.en.html">Subversion repository</a> on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml">OCaml organization</a>, which is proving popular with developers.  There is an ongoing effort to simplify the core compiler tree by splitting out some of the larger components, and so <a href="http://github.com/ocaml/camlp4">camlp4</a> is also now hosted on that organization, along with <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis">OASIS</a>.  We also administer several subdomains of <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a>, such as the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">mailing lists</a> and the <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM repository</a>, and other services such as the <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org">OCaml Forge</a> are currently migrating over.  This was made significantly easier thanks to sponsorship from <a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace Cloud</a> (users of <a href="http://xenserver.org">XenServer</a> which is written in OCaml). They saw our struggles with managing physical machines and gave us developer accounts, and all of the ocaml.org infrastructure is now hosted on Rackspace.  We're very grateful to their ongoing help!</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute to infrastructure help  (for example, I'm experimenting with a <a href="http://git.ocaml.org/public/">GitLab</a> mirror), then please join the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure@lists.ocaml.org</a> mailing list and share your thoughts.  The website team also need help with adding content and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/376">international translations</a>, so head over to the <a href="http://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues">website issue tracker</a> and start proposing improvements you'd like to see.</p>
<h4>Next steps for ocaml.org</h4>
<p>The floodgates requesting features opened up after the launch of the new look and feel.  Pretty much everyone wanted deeper OPAM integration into the main website, for features such as:</p>
<ul> <li>Starring and reviewing packages</li>
 <li>Integrating the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc">opam-doc</a> documentation with the metadata</li>
 <li>Display test results and a compatibility matrix for non-x86 and non-Linux architectures.</li>
 <li>Link to blog posts and tutorials about the package.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these features were part of the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">original wireframes</a> but we're being careful to take a long-term view of how they should be create
d and maintained.Rather than building all of this as a huge bloated <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam2web">opam2web</a> extension, David Sheets (our resident relucant-to-admit-it web expert) has designed an overlay directory scheme that permits the overlaying of different metadata onto the website. This lets one particular feature (such as blog post aggregation) be handled separately from the others via Atom aggregators.</p>
<h4>&#160;Real World OCaml</h4>
<p>A big effort that took up most of the year for me was finishing and publishing an O'Reilly book called <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a> with <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=blog/5">Yaron Minsky</a> and Jason Hickey.  Yaron describes how it all started in <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/117">his blog post</a>, but I learnt a lot from developing a book using the <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/06/17/real-world-ocaml-beta-available.html">open commenting scheme</a> that we
developed just for this.</p>
<p>In particular, the book ended up shining a bright light into dark language corners that we might otherwise not have explored in OCaml Labs.  Two chapters of the book that I wasn't satisfied with were the <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/objects.html">objects</a> and <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/classes.html">classes</a> chapters, largely since neither Yaron nor Jason nor I had ever really used their full power in our own code.  Luckily, Leo White decided to pick up the baton and champion these oft-maligned (but very powerful) features of OCaml, and the result is the clearest explanation of them that I've read yet.  Meanwhile, Jeremy Yallop helped out with extensive review of the <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/foreign-function-interface.html">Foreign Function Interface</a> chapter that used his <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes">ctypes</a> library.  Finally, <a href="https://plus.google.com/100586365409172579442/posts">Jeremie Diminio</a> at Jane Street worked hard on adding several features to his <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop">utop</a> toplevel that made it compelling enough to become our default recommendation for newcomers.</p>
<p>All in all, we ended up closing over <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/08/06/real-world-ocaml-beta2.html">2000 comments</a> in the process of writing the book, and I'm very proud of the result (freely available <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">online</a>, but do <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-World-OCaml-Functional-programming/dp/144932391X/">buy a copy</a> if you can to support it).  Still, there's more I'd like to do in 2014 to improve the ease of using OCaml further.  In particular, I removed a chapter on packaging and build systems since I wasn't happy with its quality, and both <a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> and I intend to spend time in 2014 on improving this part of the ecosystem.</p>
<h4>Tutorials and Talks</h4>
<p>We had a lively presence at <a href="http://icfpconference.org">ICFP 2013</a> this year, with the third iteration of the <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/program.html">OCaml 2013</a> held there, and Stephen Dolan presenting a paper in the main conference.  I <a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/2013/09/24/liveblogging-ocaml-workshop-2013/">liveblogged the workshop</a> as it happened, and all the <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/program.html">talks</a> we gave are linked from the program.  The most exciting part of the conference for a lot of us were the two talks by Facebook on their use of OCaml: first for <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/padioleau.pdf">program analysis using Pfff</a> and then to migrate their massive PHP codebase <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gKWNjFagR9k#t=1150">using an OCaml compiler</a>.  I also had the  opportunity to participate in a panel at the Haskell Workshop on whether <a href="http://ezyang.tumblr.com/post/62157468762/haskell-haskell-and-ghc-too-big-to-fail-panel">Haskell is too big to fail yet</a>; lots of interesting perspectives on scaling another formerly academic language into the real world.</p>
<p><a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=blog/5">Yaron Minsky</a> and I have been giving tutorials on OCaml at ICFP for several years, but the release of Real World OCaml has made it significantly easier to give tutorials without the sort of labor intensity that it took in previous years (one memorable ICFP 2011 tutorial that we did took almost 2 hours to get everyone installed with OCaml.  In ICFP 2013, it took us 15 minutes or so to get everyone started).  Still, giving tutorials at ICFP is very much preaching to the choir, and so we've started speaking at more general-purpose events.</p>
<p>Our first local effort was <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/">FPDays</a> in Cambridge, where Jeremy Yallop and Amir Chaudhry ran the tutorial with help from Phillipe Wang, Leo White and David Sheets. The OCaml session there ended up being the biggest one in the entire two days, and Amir <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-review/">wrote up</a> their experiences.  One interesting change from our ICFP tutorial is that Jeremy used <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml">js_of_ocaml</a> to teach OCaml via JavaScript by building a fun <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">Monty Hall</a> game.</p>
<h4>Visitors and Interns</h4>
<p>Since OCaml Labs is a normal group within the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge Computer Lab</a>, we often host academic visitors and interns who pass through.  This year was certainly diverse, and we welcomed a range of colleagues:</p>
<ul> <li><a href="http://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=D1161&amp;LANG=en">Mathias Bourgoin</a> has just finished his work on interfacing OCaml with GPUs, and gave us a seminar on how his <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/spoc/web/index.php?id=spoc">SPOC</a> tool works (also available in OPAM via a <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/spoc/distribution/opam/">custom remote</a>).</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.benjamin.canou.fr/">Benjamin Canou</a> (now at OCamlPro) practised his <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/canou.pdf">OCaml 2013 talk</a> on building high-level interfaces to JavaScript with OCaml by giving a departmental seminar.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.dicosmo.org/">Roberto Di Cosmo</a>, who directs the <a href="http://www.irill.org/">IRILL</a> organization on Free Software in Paris delivered a seminar on constraint solving for <a href="http://mancoosi.org">package systems</a> that are as large-scale as Debian's.</li>
 <li><a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> visited during the summer to help plot the <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/mirage-1.0.3-released">Mirage 1.0</a> and <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/20/opam-1-1-beta.html">OPAM 1.1</a> releases.  He has also since joined OCaml Labs fulltime to work on <a href="http://nymote.org">Nymote</a>.</li>
 <li><a href="http://louis.gesbert.fr/cv.en.html">Louis Gesbert</a> from OCamlPro visited for 2 weeks in December and kicked off the inaugral OPAM developers summit (which was, admittedly, just 5 developers in the <a href="http://www.kingston-arms.co.uk/">Kingston Arms</a>, but all good things start in a pub, right?)</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.xulforum.org/">Jonathan Protzenko</a> presented his PhD work on <a href="http://protz.github.io/mezzo/">Mezzo</a> (which is now <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/mezzo-on-opam/">merged into OPAM</a>), and educated us on the vagaries of <a href="http://protz.github.io/ocaml-installer/">Windows support</a>.</li>
 <li><a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/">Gabriel Scherer</a> from the Gallium INRIA group visited to discuss the direction of OPAM and various language feature discussions (such as namespaces).  He didn't give a talk, but promises to do so next time!</li>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/bvaugon">Beno&#238;t Vaugon</a> gave a seminar on his <a href="http://oud.ocaml.org/2012/slides/oud2012-paper10-slides.pdf">OCamlCC</a> OCaml-to-C compiler, talked about porting OCaml to <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaml_for_pic/web/index.php?id=ocapic">8-bit PICs</a>, and using GADTs to <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6017">implement Printf</a> properly.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were also visited several times by <a href="http://danmey.org/">Wojciech Meyer</a> from ARM, who was an OCaml developer who maintained (among other things) the <a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild">ocamlbuild</a> system and worked on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Hg5L76FG8">DragonKit</a> (an extensible LLVM-like compiler written in OCaml).  Wojciech very sadly passed away on November 18th, and we all fondly remember his enthusiastic and intelligent contributions to our small Cambridge community.</p>
<p>We also hosted visitors to live in Cambridge and work with us over the summer.  In addition to Vincent Botbol (who worked on OPAM-doc as described earlier) we had the pleasure of having <a href="http://erratique.ch/">Daniel B&#252;nzli</a> and <a href="http://www.x9c.fr/">Xavier Clerc</a> work here.  Here's what they did in their own words.</p>
<h5>Xavier Clerc: OCamlJava</h5>
<p>Xavier Clerc took a break from his regular duties at INRIA to join us over the summer
to work on <a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/">OCaml-Java</a> and adapt it to the latest
JVM features.  This is an incredibly important project to bridge OCaml with the huge
Java community, and here's his report:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a four-month visit to the OCaml Labs dedicated to the <a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/">OCaml-Java</a>
project, the time has come for an appraisal! The undertaken work can be split
into two areas: improvements to code generation, and interaction between the
OCaml &amp; Java languages.  Regarding code generation, several classical
optimizations have been added to the compiler, for example loop unrolling,
more aggressive unboxing, better handling of globals, or partial evaluation
(at the bytecode level). A new tool, namely ocamljar, has been introduced
allowing post-compilation optimizations. The underlying idea is that some
optimizations cannot always be applied (e.g. depending whether multiple
threads/programs will coexist), but enabling them through command-line flags
would lead to recompilation and/or multiple installations of each library
according to the set of chosen optimizations. It is thus far more easier to
first build an executable jar file, and then modify it according to these
optimizations. Furthermore, this workflow allows the ocamljar tool to take
advantage of whole-program information for some optimizations.  All these
improvements, combined, often lead to a gain of roughly 1/3 in terms of
execution time.</p>
<p>Regarding language interoperability, there are actually two directions 
depending on whether you want to call OCaml code from Java, or want to call 
Java code from OCaml. For the first direction, a tool allows to generate Java
source files from OCaml compiled interfaces, mapping the various constructs
of the OCaml language to Java classes. It is then possible to call functions, 
and to manipulate instances of OCaml types in pure Java, still benefiting 
from the type safety provided by the OCaml language. In the other direction,
an extension of the OCaml typer is provided allowing to create and manipulate
Java instances directly from OCaml sources. This typer extension is indeed a
thin layer upon the original OCaml typer, that is mainly responsible for
encoding Java types into OCaml types.  This encoding uses a number of
advanced elements such as polymorphic variants, subtyping, variance
annotations, phantom typing, and printf-hack, but the end-user does not have
to be aware of this encoding. On the surface, the type of instances of the
Java Object classes is <code>java'lang'Object java_instance</code>, and instances can be
created by calling Java.make <code>Object()</code>.</p>
<p>While still under heavy development, a working prototype <a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/">is available</a>, and bugs <a href="http://bugs.x9c.fr/">can be reported</a>. Finally, I would like to thank the OCaml Labs for providing a great working
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Daniel B&#252;nzli: Typography and Visualisation</h5>
<p>Daniel joined us from Switzerland, and spent some time at Citrix before joining us in OCaml Labs.  All of his <a href="http://erratique.ch/software">software</a> is now on OPAM, and is seeing ever-increasing adoption from the community.</p>
<blockquote><p>Released a first version of <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vg">Vg</a> [...] I'm
especially happy about that as I wanted to use and work on these ideas since
at least 2008. The project is a long term project and is certainly not
finished yet but this is already a huge step.</p>
<p>Adjusted and released a first version of
<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/gg">Gg</a>. While the module was already mostly
written before my arrival to Cambridge, the development of Vg and Vz prompted
me to make some changes to the module.</p>
<p>[...] released <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/otfm">Otfm</a>, a
module to decode OpenType fonts. This is a work in progress as not every
OpenType table has built-in support for decoding yet. But since it is needed
by Vg's PDF renderer I had to cut a release. It can however already be used
to implement certain simple things like font kerning with Vg, this can be
seen in action in the <code>vecho</code> binary installed by Vg.</p>
<p>Started to work on <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vz/doc/Vz.html">Vz</a>, a
module for helping to map data to Vg images. This is really unfinished and is
still considered to be at a design stage. There are a few things that are
however well implemented like (human) perceptually meaningful <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vz/demos/color_schemes.html">color
palettes</a> and the
small folding stat module (<code>Vz.Stat</code>). However it quickly became evident that
I needed to have more in the box w.r.t. text rendering in Vg/Otfm. Things
like d3js entirely rely on the SVG/CSS support for text which makes it easy
to e.g. align things (like tick labels on <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vz/demos/iris.html">such
drawings</a>). If you can't
rely on that you need ways of measuring rendered text. So I decided to
suspend the work on Vz and put more energy in making a first good release of
Vg. Vz still needs quite some design work, especially since it tries to be
independent of Vg's backend and from the mechanism for user input.</p>
<p>Spent some time figuring out a new "opam-friendly" release workflow in 
pkgopkg. One of my problem is that by designing in the small for programming
in the large --- what a slogan --- the number of packages I'm publishing is
growing (12 and still counting). This means that I need to scale horizontally
maintenance-wise unhelped by the sad state of build systems for OCaml. I need
tools that make the release process flawless, painless and up to my quality
standards. This lead me to enhance and consolidate my old scattered
distribution scripts in that repo, killing my dependencies on Oasis and
ocamlfind along the way. <em>(edited for brevity, see <a href="https://github.com/dbuenzli/pkgopkg">here</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daniel also left his bicycle here for future visitors to use, and the "B&#252;nzli-bike"
is available for our next visitor! (Louis Gesbert even donated lights, giving
it a semblance of safety).</p>
<h4>Industrial Fellows</h4>
<p>Most of our regular funding bodies such as <a href="http://epsrc.ac.uk">EPSRC</a> or <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html">EU FP7</a> provide funding, but leave all the intellectual input to the academics.  A compelling aspect of OCaml Labs has been how involved our industrial colleagues have been with the day-to-day problems that we solve.  Both Jane Street and Citrix have senior staff regularly visiting our group and working alongside us as industrial fellows in the Computer Lab.</p>
<ul> <li><a href="http://www.three-tuns.net/mark/">Mark Shinwell</a> from Jane Street Europe has been working on improving the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF2WpWnB-nk">state of native debugging</a> in OCaml, by adding extended DWARF debugging information to the compiler output.  Mark is also a useful source of feedback about the forthcoming design of multicore, since he has daily insight into a huge production codebase at Jane Street (and can tell us about it without us requiring access!).</li>
 <li><a href="http://dave.recoil.org">Dave Scott</a> is the principal architect of <a href="http://xenserver.org">XenServer</a> at Citrix in Cambridge.  This year has been transformative for that project, since Citrix <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2013/06/26/open-source-what-does-it-mean-for-xenserver/">open-sourced XenServer</a> to GitHub and fully adopted OPAM into their workflow.  Dave is the author of numerous libraries that have all been released to OPAM, and his colleagues <a href="http://jon.recoil.org">Jon Ludlam</a> and <a href="http://www.xenserver.org/blog/blogger/listings/euanh.html">Euan Harris</a> are also regular visitors who have also been contributors to the OPAM and Mirage ecosystems.

<h3>Research Projects</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>The other 100% of our time at the Labs is spent on research projects.  When we started the group, I wanted to set up a feedback loop between local people <em>using</em> OCaml to build systems, with the folk <em>developing</em> OCaml itself.  This has worked out particularly well with a couple of big research projects in the Lab.</p>
<h4>&#160;Mirage</h4>
<p>Mirage is a <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">library operating system</a> written in OCaml that compiles source code into specialised Xen microkernels, developed at the Cambridge Computer Lab, Citrix and the <a href="http://horizon.ac.uk">Horizon Digital Economy</a> institute at Nottingham.  This year saw several years of effort culminate in the first release of <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage 1.0</a> as a self-hosting entity.  While Mirage started off as a <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-hotcloud-lamp.pdf">quick experiment</a> into building specialised virtual appliances, it rapidly became useful to make into a real system for use in bigger research projects.  You can learn more about Mirage <a href="http://openmirage.org/docs">here</a>, or read the <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/1/170866-unikernels/abstract">Communications of the ACM</a> article that <a href="http://dave.recoil.org">Dave Scott</a> and I wrote to close out the year.</p>
<p>This project is where the OCaml Labs "feedback loop" has been strongest.  A typical <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/hello-world">Mirage application</a> consists of around 50 libraries that are all installed via OPAM.  These range from <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-xen">device drivers</a> to protocol libraries for <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp">HTTP</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns">DNS</a>, to filesystems such as <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-fat">FAT32</a>.  Coordinating <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/mirage-1.0.3-released">regular releases</a> of all of these would be near impossible without using OPAM, and has also forced us to use our own tools daily, helping to sort out bugs more quickly.  You can see the full list of libraries on the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/pkg/">OCaml Labs software page</a>.</p>
<p>Mirage is also starting to share code with big projects such as <a href="http://xenserver.org">XenServer</a> now, and we have been working with Citrix engineers to help them to move to the <a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com">Core</a> library that Jane Street has released (and that is covered in <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a>).  Moving production codebases this large can take years, but OCaml Labs is turning out to be a good place to start unifying some of the bigger users of OCaml into one place.  We're also now an official <a href="http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/mirage-os.html">Xen Project incubator project</a>, which helps us to validate functional programming  to other Linux Foundation efforts.</p>
<h4>Nymote and User Centric Networking</h4>
<p>The release of Mirage 1.0 has put us on the road to simplifying embedded systems programming. The move to the centralized cloud has led to regular well-publicised privacy and security threats to the way <a href="http://de2013.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/de2013_submission_25-1.pdf">we handle</a> our digital infrastructure, and so <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/">Jon Crowcroft</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rmm/">Richard Mortier</a> and I are leading an effort to build an alternative privacy-preserving infrastructure using embedded devices as part of the <a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu/">User Centric Networking</a> project, in collaboration with a host of companies led by <a href="http://www.thlab.net/">Technicolor</a> Paris.
This work also plays on the strong points of OCaml: it already has a <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2012/02/25/dreamplug-debian-and-ocaml.html">fast ARM backend</a>, and Mirage can easily be ported to the new Xen/ARM target as hardware becomes available.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of programming on the "wide area" Internet are dealing with the lack of a distributed identity service that's fully secure.  We published <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-foci-signposts.pdf">our thoughts</a> on this at the USENIX Free and Open Communications on the Internet workhsop, and David Sheets is working towards a full implementation using Mirage.  If you're interested in following this effort, Amir Chaudhry is blogging at the <a href="http://nymote.org/">Nymote</a> project website, where we'll talk about the components as they are released.</p>
<h4>&#160;Data Center Networking</h4>
<p>At the other extreme from embedded programming is datacenter networking, and we started the <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K034723/1">Network-as-a-Service</a> research project with <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K032968/1">Imperial College</a> and <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K031724/1">Nottingham</a>.  With the rapid rise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">Software Defined Networking</a> this year, we are investigating how application-specific customisation of network resources can build fast, better, cheaper infrasructure.  OCaml is in a good position here: several other groups have built OpenFlow controllers in OCaml (most notably, the <a href="https://github.com/frenetic-lang">Frenetic Project</a>), and Mirage is specifically designed to assemble such bespoke infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another aspect we've been considering is how to solve the problem of optimal connectivity across nodes.  TCP is increasingly considered harmful in high-through, high-density clusters, and <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/people/peoplelists/person/334868">George Parisis</a> led the design of <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-hotnets-trevi.pdf">Trevi</a>, which is a fountain-coding based alternative for storage networking.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> (who joined OCaml Labs in November), has been working on a branch-consistent data store called <a href="https://github.com/samoht/irminsule">Irminsule</a> which supports scalable data sharing and reconciliation using Mirage.  Both of these systems will see implementations based on the research done this year.</p>
<h4>&#160;Higher Kinded Programming</h4>
<p>Jeremy Yallop and Leo White have been developing an approach that makes it possible to write programs with higher-kinded polymorphism (such as monadic functions that are polymorphic in the monad they use) without using functors. It's early days yet, but there's a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/higher">library</a> available on <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/pkg/higher/higher.0.1">OPAM</a> that implements the approach, and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/higher/raw/paper/higher.pdf">draft
paper</a> that outlines the design.</p>
<h3>Priorities for 2014</h3>
<p>This year has been a wild ride to get us up to speed, but we now have a solid sense of what to work on for 2014.  We've decided on a high-level set of priorities led by the senior members of the group:</p>
<ul> <li><strong>Multicore</strong>: Leo White will be leading efforts in putting an end-to-end multicore capable OCaml together.</li>
 <li><strong>Metaprogramming</strong>: Jeremy Yallop will direct the metaprogramming efforts, continuing with Ctypes and into macros and extension points.</li>
 <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Thomas Gazagnaire will continue to drive OPAM development towards becoming the first <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/madhavapeddy.pdf">OCaml Platform</a>.</li>
 <li><strong>Online</strong>: Amir Chaudhry will develop the online and community efforts that started in 2013.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are guidelines to choosing where to spend our time, but not excluding other work or day-to-day bugfixing. Our focus on collaboration with Jane Street, Citrix, Lexifi, OCamlPro and our existing colleagues will continue, as well as warmly welcoming new community members that wish to work with us on any of the projects, either via internships, studentships or good old-fashioned open source hacking.</p>
<p>I appreciate the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/people/">whole team's</a> feedback in editing this long post into shape, the amazing professorial support from <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/">Jon Crowcroft</a>, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~iml1/">Ian Leslie</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/">Alan Mycroft</a> throughout the year, and of course the funding and support from Jane Street, Citrix, RCUK, EPSRC, DARPA and the EU FP7 that made all this possible.  Roll on 2014, and please do <a href="mailto:avsm2@cl.cam.ac.uk">get in touch</a> with me with any queries!</p>

<p>( This post is part of a series in which I am
<a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/06/09/choosing-a-python-replacement-for-0install">converting 0install from Python to OCaml</a>, learning OCaml as I go. )</p>

<h2>Subtyping</h2>

<p>The first thing that confused me was that OCaml tends to use <em>parametric polymorphism</em> where other languages use <em>subtyping</em> (&#8220;subtype polymorphism&#8221;), so I&#8217;ll start with a brief summary of subtyping and then show how OCaml uses parametric polymorphism to achieve similar ends.</p>

<p>Note: in the rest of this article I will always use &#8220;polymorphism&#8221; to mean &#8220;parametric polymorphism&#8221;, which is the way the OCaml documentation uses it.</p>

<p>When you think of object oriented programming, you probably think of the types arranged in a tree. In fact, with multiple-inheritance of interfaces,
the types form a <em>lattice</em>, which is easier to draw than to explain:</p>

<p><img class="border center" src="http://roscidus.com/blog/images/lattice.png" /></p>

<p>On the left, we have some example primitive types, <code>int</code> and <code>unit</code>.</p>

<p>In the middle, we have some GUI object types. <code>widget</code> represents &#8220;things that can appear on the screen&#8221;. <code>button</code> and <code>window</code> are types of <code>widget</code> and a <code>dialog</code> is a type of <code>window</code>. For example, any function that can operate on windows can also operate on dialogs. A <code>button</code> is both a <code>widget</code> and an <code>action</code>. In Java terms, we might write <code>class Button implements Widget, Action</code>.</p>

<p>On the right, we have some variant types (enums). The type &#8220;yes or no&#8221; is a sub-type of &#8220;yes, no or maybe&#8221;. For example, a function that can format a yes/no/maybe value as a string will also work on the simpler yes/no type.</p>

<p>The rule is that you can always safely cast a type to a super type (going upwards). However, casting in Java and OCaml work differently:</p>

<p>In Java:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>Upcasting (converting to a type higher up in the lattice) is automatic and implicit. e.g. in <code>Widget w = new Dialog();</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downcasting">Downcasting</a> requires an explicit cast, and may throw an exception: <code>Dialog d = (Dialog) w</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In OCaml:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>Upcasting must be explicit, e.g. <code>let w : widget = (new dialog :&gt; widget)</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Downcasting is impossible (types are not recorded at runtime, so it wouldn&#8217;t be able to check).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example that might surprise you if you&#8217;re expecting automatic upcasts:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<pre><code>Error: This expression has type dialog but an expression was expected of type window
       The second object type has no method get_response
</code></pre>

<p>OCaml won&#8217;t let you pass a dialog to <code>close_window</code> because it&#8217;s a <code>dialog</code>, not a <code>window</code> and there are no automatic coercions in OCaml. However, OCaml does know the subtyping relationship and will therefore let you cast it:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">dialog</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">close_window</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">:&gt;</span> <span class="n">window</span><span class="o">)</span>	<span class="c">(* OK *)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Functions also have types and can be cast too, so here&#8217;s another way to solve this problem:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">dialog</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">close_window</span> <span class="o">:&gt;</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">dialog</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">unit</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Here, we upcast <code>close_window</code> to the type <code>dialog -&gt; unit</code> and then pass it a <code>dialog</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, notice that <code>dialog</code> is a <em>subtype</em> of <code>window</code> but <code>dialog -&gt; unit</code> is a <em>super-type</em> of <code>window -&gt; unit</code>. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)">covariance and contravariance</a> for the details about that.</p>

<h3>Top and bottom</h3>

<p>The types <em>top</em> and <em>bottom</em> don&#8217;t seem to exist in OCaml, but I included them for completeness and because they&#8217;re conceptually interesting and you&#8217;ll probably run across these terms when reading anything about types.</p>

<p><em>Top</em> is a super-type of everything, like <code>object</code> in Python (or <code>Object</code> in Java, if you ignore unboxed types). Everything is a top and, therefore, knowing that something is a top tells you nothing at all. Because OCaml doesn&#8217;t allow downcasting, there&#8217;s not much you could do with a top in OCaml anyway.</p>

<p><em>Bottom</em> is a sub-type of everything. A value of type bottom can be used as an int, a widget, a yes/no enum, etc. Needless to say, instances of this type don&#8217;t actually exist.</p>

<p>Although OCaml doesn&#8217;t have a bottom type, it achieves the same effect with polymorphism.
For example, the result of these expressions can be used as any type you like:</p>

<ul>  <li><code>exit 1</code> (exits the program)</li>
  <li><code>failwith msg</code> (throws an exception)</li>
  <li><code>let rec loop () = loop () in loop ()</code> (infinite loop)</li>
  <li><code>Obj.magic x</code> (unsafe cast; program may segfault if you get it wrong!)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, this code compiles fine, even though we use <code>bot</code> as an <code>int</code> and as a <code>string</code>:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2>Polymorphism</h2>

<p>If you treat OCaml like Java then things mostly work fine; you just end up doing a lot of explicit casting. However, where Java uses implicit upcasts, OCaml generally prefers using <em>(parametric) polymorphism</em>.</p>

<p>A polymorphic value doesn&#8217;t have a single concrete type. Instead, it can take on many different types as needed.
For example, the OCaml function <code>Queue.create</code> can create queues of ints, queues of strings, etc. Its type is <code>unit -&gt; 'a Queue.t</code>, where <code>'a</code> is a <em>type variable</em>. When you want to use this function, you can use any type (e.g. <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>) as the value of <code>'a</code>, to get a function that makes queues of ints or queues of strings, as needed.</p>

<p>Note that unlike e.g. C++ templates, using polymorphism does not create any extra code. There is only ever one <code>Queue.create</code> function compiled into your binary, not one for each type you use. The same generic code works for queues of ints and queues of strings.</p>

<p>In Java, upcasting types is implicit, while using polymorphism (generics) requires extra annotations. In OCaml, it&#8217;s the other way around. Polymorphism is implicit, while upcasting requires annotations. So, in Java:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="java"><span class="line"><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">LinkedList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"hello"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"world"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The <code>&lt;String&gt;</code> parts show where we convert a generic type (list of X) to a concrete type (list of String). In OCaml, this happens implicitly:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">linked_list</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"world"</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>(Note: I used a made-up <code>linked_list</code> class rather than <code>Queue</code> to keep this example similar to the Java)</p>

<p>This saves a lot of typing, which is good, but it also makes it far harder to understand what&#8217;s going on.
The way I think of it, OCaml adds type variables at certain points in the code and then uses type inference to work out what they are.
So in this case, we have (note: this is not valid OCaml syntax):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">linked_list</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"world"</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Then OCaml infers that <code>type t = string</code>.</p>

<h3>Polymorphic objects</h3>

<p>The problem with our <code>close_window</code> function in the subtyping section was that we gave it a fixed concrete type (<code>window -&gt; unit</code>):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">close_window</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">window</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">unit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">w</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">close</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>If we give it a polymorphic type then there&#8217;s no problem:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">close_window_poly</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">:#</span><span class="n">window</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">unit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">w</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">close</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">dialog</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">close_window_poly</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Here, <code>#window</code> means any type with at least the methods of <code>window</code> (not to be confused with <code>w#close</code>, which is a method call, not a type). The syntax is a bit confusing because OCaml hides the type variable by default. If you wanted to declare the type of <code>close_window_poly</code> explicitly, you&#8217;d have to make the type variable explicit using <code>as</code>. For comparison, here are the types of the two versions:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">window_closer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">window</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">unit</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">closer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(#</span><span class="n">window</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">unit</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Thus the type <code>window closer</code> is the type of functions that close a <code>window</code>, while <code>dialog closer</code> is the type of functions that close a <code>dialog</code>. OCaml will automatically apply the appropriate type at compile time.</p>

<p>As OCaml will infer polymorphic types automatically, we can define and call the function without any type annotations at all:</p>

<pre><code># let close_window_inf w = w#close;;
val close_window_inf : &lt; close : 'a; .. &gt; -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
# close_window_inf d;;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is yet more new syntax! OCaml didn&#8217;t infer that this requires a <code>#window</code>, only that it requires something with a suitable <code>close</code> method. Also, it couldn&#8217;t infer that <code>close</code> must return <code>unit</code>, so it left the return type generic as <code>'a</code>. </p>

<p>The <code>..</code> indicates more polymorphism, with another hidden type variable. If we wanted to define the type for this function, it would be:</p>

<pre><code>type ('a, 'b) closer2 = (&lt; close : 'a; .. &gt; as 'b) -&gt; 'a
</code></pre>

<p>This is the polymorphic type for functions which take objects of type <code>'b</code>, where <code>'b</code> includes a <code>close</code> method that returns an <code>'a</code>, and return an <code>'a</code>.</p>

<p>For example, the original <code>close_window</code> function has the type <code>(unit, window) closer2</code>.</p>

<p>What all this means is that defining objects and functions without explicit types usually works fine, but if you later try to add type annotations (e.g. by declaring an interface for your module in an <code>.mli</code> file) then you&#8217;re likely to remove the polymorphism accidentally unless you&#8217;re careful. If you don&#8217;t understand what happened, you&#8217;ll end up doing a load of explicit casting to make things work again.</p>

<p>A good way around this is to use <code>ocamlc -i</code> to generate an initial <code>.mli</code> file with all the inferred types, with all the polymorphism still there.</p>

<p>In another bit of inconsistent syntax, when defining a class type you need to put the type parameter in brackets, but you don&#8217;t when declaring an object type:</p>

<p>Again, if you&#8217;re expecting subtyping behaviour then this is confusing. If we can draw a balloon blue, black or red, why can&#8217;t we draw it blue or black? Again, we can use an upcast (which is checked by the compiler and is entirely type-safe):</p>

<p>Here <code>[&lt; `blue | `black | `red ]</code> means all subtypes of <code>[ `blue | `black | `red ]</code>. The <code>&lt;</code> introduces another hidden type variable. If you wanted to define a type for this function explicitly, you could do it with:</p>

<pre><code>type 'a balloon_painter = ([&lt;`blue | `black | `red ] as 'a) -&gt; unit
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of <code>&lt;</code>, there&#8217;s also <code>&gt;</code>, which means the variant must have <em>at least</em> the given elements.</p>

<p>As before, just removing the type annotations and letting OCaml infer the polymorphic type is easy:</p>

<p>OCaml will automatically infer <code>'a</code> as <code>[`close | `delete]</code> - a dialog with close and delete responses.
OCaml will force you to handle every response code, so you can&#8217;t add a button but forget to handle it!
The <code>constraint 'a = [&gt; `close]</code> line forces you to handle the <code>close</code> response in all cases (because the user could always just close the window).</p>

<p>For another example, see my earlier post 
<a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/08/31/option-handling-with-ocaml-polymorphic-variants/">Option Handling With OCaml Polymorphic Variants</a>.</p>

<h2>Other issues</h2>

<h3>Monomorphic types</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s a subtle but important distinction between <em>polymorphic types</em> (which can be used to generate many concrete types) and <em>monomorphic types</em> (which OCaml uses to mean a single type that is currently undecided). Monomorphic types only occur while OCaml is still working out the types, so you&#8217;ll only see them in compiler error messages or in the interactive toplevel. They look like regular type variables but start with an underscore. e.g.</p>

<pre><code># let x = [];;
val x : 'a list = []

# let y = ref None;;
val y : '_a option ref = {contents = None}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>x</code> has a polymorphic type (using <code>'a</code>). It can be used as an empty list of ints, or as an empty list of strings, or both. Every time you use <code>x</code>, you get to pick a type for it.</p>

<p><code>y</code> has a monomorphic type (using <code>'_a</code>). It can be used as a mutable container of ints, or of strings, but not both. As soon as OCaml sees it used with a concrete type, it will assign that type for it:</p>

<pre><code># let y = ref None;;
# y;;
- : '_a option ref = {contents = None}

# y := Some 3;;
# y := None;;
# y;;
- : int option ref = {contents = None}

# y := Some "hello";;
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type int
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the second time we print <code>y</code>, OCaml has worked out the concrete type.</p>

<p>Note: The term &#8220;weakly polymorphic&#8221; seems to be used as an alias for &#8220;monomorphic&#8221; in some OCaml documentation.</p>

<h3>Partial application loses polymorphism</h3>

<p>Partially-applied functions lose their polymorphism. Consider:</p>

<pre><code># let p1 = Printf.fprintf;;
val p1 : out_channel -&gt; ('a, out_channel, unit) format -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;

# let p2 = Printf.fprintf stdout;;
val p2 : ('_a, out_channel, unit) format -&gt; '_a = &lt;fun&gt;

# let p3 fmt = Printf.fprintf stdout fmt;;
val p3 : ('a, out_channel, unit) format -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>fprintf</code> is a polymorphic function. It takes an output channel, a format string (with a polymorphic type) and values of the appropriate type. <code>p1</code> retains the polymorphic type.
However, <code>p2</code>, which partially applies the function to <code>stdout</code>, has a monomorphic type (<code>'_a</code>). You could use <code>p2</code> to print a string, or to print an int, but you couldn&#8217;t use it twice to do both.
<code>p3</code>, which just makes the format argument explicit, is polymorphic again!</p>

The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/faq/core.en.html">OCaml FAQ</a> explains what to do about it (use <code>p3</code>), but doesn&#8217;t explain why.
As <code>fprintf</code> has a really complicated type, let&#8217;s switch to a simpler example:</p>

<p><code>logged_id msg x</code> prints the message and then just returns <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>The polymorphism is lost in <code>i2</code> because OCaml doesn&#8217;t know, from the type of <code>logged_id</code>, whether partially applying it will create any mutable state. Consider:</p>

<p>When <code>logged_mem</code> is partially applied, it creates a mutable cell and returns a function that remembers the first value it is called with and always returns that.
The result of <code>logged_mem "called"</code> cannot be polymorphic: it must always be called with the same argument type. Yet <code>logged_mem</code> has the same type as <code>logged_id</code> (<code>string -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a</code>), so OCaml can&#8217;t distinguish the two cases.</p>

<p>OCaml assumes that every function call potentially creates mutable state. Therefore, the result of calling a function is never polymorphic. Normally that&#8217;s what you want, but it can be surprising in the case of partial functions. The solution (<code>i3</code>) is to avoid partial application and do a complete fresh invocation each time.</p>

<p>There are actually some cases where OCaml can turn a monomorphic result type back into a polymorphic one. For example:</p>

<pre><code># let make_empty () = [];;
val make_empty : unit -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;

# let x = make_empty ();;
val x : 'a list = []
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>x</code> gets a polymorphic type despite being the result of a function call.
See <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-fiwflp04.pdf">Relaxing the Value Restriction</a> for how it does that.</p>

<h3>Universal qualification</h3>

<p>This surprised me at first:</p>

<pre><code># let id = fun x -&gt; x;;
val id : 'a -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;

# let id2 : ('a -&gt; 'a) = fun x -&gt; x + 1;;
val id2 : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>OCaml tells us that the identity function <code>id</code> has the type <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>. OK. Then I declare another function with the same type, and OCaml tells me its type is <code>int -&gt; int</code>!</p>

<p>OCaml is hiding part of the type! The real type of the identity function is <code>'a. 'a -&gt; 'a</code> (given <code>'a</code>, the type is <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>). Using this full type, we get the expected error:</p>

<pre><code># let id : 'a. 'a -&gt; 'a = fun x -&gt; x;;
val id : 'a -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;

# let id2 : 'a. 'a -&gt; 'a = fun x -&gt; x + 1;;
Error: This definition has type int -&gt; int which is less general than
         'a. 'a -&gt; 'a
</code></pre>

<p>The input to the polymorphic type expression (the <code>'a.</code> bit) can only go at the start of a type expression in OCaml. That means that you can&#8217;t write a function that takes a polymorphic function as an argument. For example:</p>

<pre><code># let use_id (id : 'a. 'a -&gt; 'a) =
    assert (id 3 = 3);
    assert (id "hi" = "hi") ;;
Error: Syntax error: type expected.
</code></pre>

<p>However, you can put them in object method and record field types:</p>

<p>So, you may have to wrap some things up in objects or records. If you use this in a method type, make sure you declare the type of the object you&#8217;re creating. Otherwise, OCaml will infer the wrong type (it will assume that <code>'a</code> is scoped to the whole object, not a single method):</p>

<h3>Polymorphism in module signatures</h3>

<p>When you define a module, you can (optionally) write an <code>.mli</code> file giving it a more limited public interface.
In this interface, you can make types abstract, only expose certain functions, etc. 
If you include a value with concrete type, the signature must be the same in the module and in the interface.
But when your module contains polymorphic values, you are allowed to limit the polymorphism in the module signature. For example:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>test.mli </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">close_window</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="n">dialog</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">unit</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>test.ml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">close_window</span> <span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">w</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">close</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">window</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">close_window</span> <span class="n">w</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Inside the module, <code>close_window</code> will close anything with a <code>close</code> method and return whatever it returns.
But outside the module, <code>close_window</code> can only close subclasses of <code>dialog</code> (and always returns unit).</p>

<h2>Cheat-sheet</h2>

<p>Some concrete types:</p>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th>Type expression</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>    <tr>      <td><code>int list</code></td>
      <td>a list of integers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>int -&gt; int</code></td>
      <td>a function that takes an <code>int</code> and returns an <code>int</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>widget</code></td>
      <td>the concrete type <code>widget</code> exactly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>&lt;close : unit&gt;</code></td>
      <td>an object type with a single <code>close</code> method</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>[`red|`green]</code></td>
      <td>the variant type &#8220;red or green&#8221;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Some polymorphic types (supplying the type parameter <code>'a</code> will produce some concrete type):</p>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th>Type expression</th>
      <th>Can produce types for&#8230;</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>    <tr>      <td><code>'a list</code></td>
      <td>any list of items, each of the same type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>'a -&gt; 'a</code></td>
      <td>any function that returns something of the same type as its input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>(#widget as 'a)</code></td>
      <td>any type that includes all the methods of <code>widget</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>(&lt;close : unit; ..&gt; as 'a)</code></td>
      <td>any type with at least a <code>close : unit</code> method</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>([&lt; `red|`green] as 'a)</code></td>
      <td>any variant with some subset of <code>red</code> and <code>green</code> as options</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td><code>([&gt; `red|`green] as 'a)</code></td>
      <td>any variant with some superset of <code>red</code> and <code>green</code> as options</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can omit the <code>as 'a</code> bits, unless you need to refer to <code>'a</code> somewhere else.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Java uses subtyping by default (automatically), with extra syntax for using generics (polymorphism). OCaml uses polymorphism by default, with extra syntax for using subtypes. Polymorphism is powerful, but can be confusing. If you allow OCaml to infer types, it will infer polymorphic types automatically and everything should work, but you&#8217;ll want to understand polymorphism when you come to writing module signatures and you need to write out the types.</p>

<p>When the compiler and the interactive OCaml interpreter display polymorphic types, they frequently omit the type variables, which can make learning OCaml more difficult. Polymorphic object types, class types and variants all use different syntax to indicate polymorphism, which can also be confusing.</p>

<p>OCaml uses &#8220;monomorphic type&#8221; to mean a single (non-polymorphic) type which has not yet been inferred. Monomorphic types occur when you create mutable state or call functions (which may create mutable state internally). This explains why partially applying a function loses its polymorphism.</p>

<p>OCaml does not allow functions that take polymorphic arguments (arguments that remain polymorphic within the function, rather than being resolved to a particular concrete type when the function is called). However, you can work around this using record or object types.</p>

<p>When defining a module&#8217;s signature (its external API), you can&#8217;t change concrete types but you can expose less polymorphism in polymorphic types if you want.</p>

  <li>Once we have these, we find a dependency on the library <a href="http://simamo.de/0install/armagetronad-libs-Linux-x86_64.xml">http://simamo.de/0install/armagetronad-libs-Linux-x86_64.xml</a>, so we download that XML file too.</li>
  <li>Once all the XML downloads have finished, we select a version of Armagetron (0.2.8.3.2 in my case) and its (single) declared library (version 0.3-pre0.1570 here).</li>
  <li>We download these two tar.bz2 files (concurrently) and unpack them to the cache.</li>
  <li>Finally, we run (as described in previous posts).</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s the overall process. It&#8217;s not totally trivial, but in fact some of the steps are complex in themselves. For example, to download a single feed (XML) file:</p>

<ol>  <li>We download the feed from the given URL.</li>
  <li>We check the GPG signature on the feed. If we don&#8217;t have the GPG key, we must download that next.</li>
  <li>Once we&#8217;ve checked that the signature is valid, we need to decide whether to trust it. We download information from the key information server.</li>
  <li>Depending on the user&#8217;s configuration and the key information server&#8217;s response, we may show a confirmation dialog to the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition:</p>

<ol>  <li>If the primary site (simamo.de) fails, we try the mirror site <a href="http://roscidus.com/0mirror/">http://roscidus.com/0mirror/</a> instead.</li>
  <li>If the primary site is slow, we ask the mirror too. If the primary then succeeds, we cancel the mirror download. If the mirror succeeds first, we use the information we got from it to find more required downloads, but also continue waiting for the primary (which may have more up-to-date information).</li>
  <li>If the key information server is slow, we display the dialog to the user anyway, but update the display if the information arrives while the user is pondering.</li>
  <li>We never use more than 2 HTTP connections per site at the same time. Further requests are queued.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, there&#8217;s quite a bit of logic here (and there&#8217;s still the archive downloads too&#8230;). How can we make sure all these operations happen at the right time and that errors are handled correctly?</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p>Note that the challenge here is not to use multiple CPUs in parallel to perform some calculation faster, but to schedule and manage multiple concurrent operations. The effects of concurrency will be visible (i.e. the behaviour of the code, such as whether we decide to contact the mirror server or not, depends on how quickly things happen). Therefore, some non-determinism is unavoidable. However, we want to minimise it.</p>

<p>Most languages provide some kind of low-level <em>preemptive multi-threading</em> support, e.g. Python&#8217;s <code>threading.create</code>, Haskell&#8217;s <code>forkIO</code>, OCaml&#8217;s <code>Thread.create</code>, Java&#8217;s <code>java.lang.Thread</code> and Go&#8217;s <code>go</code>. In these cases, all threads always run in parallel by default. If two threads access a shared or global variable without appropriate locking, the program will occasionally fail in ways that are hard to reproduce or diagnose.</p>

<p>Of course, these languages provide mutexes, channels, etc to make correct code possible, but this style is unsafe by default. For example, if a multi-threaded program uses some library from multiple threads, and the author of the library was only thinking about single-threaded use, then you likely have a subtle, hard-to-trigger bug.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider a simplified example: we want to fetch information from the key information server, parse it, and confirm the key with the user (this server says things like &#8220;This key belongs to a registered Debian developer&#8221;).
Within each thread, we might do something like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">confirm_key</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">feed</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">download_key_info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">feed</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sig</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">info</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parse_key_info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">ok</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">confirm_with_gui</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">feed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">info</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Probably this code will crash if two keys are downloaded close together, because the graphical toolkit library used to show the GUI isn&#8217;t thread-safe. But there could be similar issues with any code we call (is <code>parse_key_info</code> thread-safe, for example? What about the XML parser it uses? etc).</p>

<p>So how can we avoid these problems? Rust uses its linear types to prevent concurrent access to mutable state, which looks very useful. For other languages, we can use <em>cooperative multi-threading</em>.</p>

<p>The idea here is that instead of running threads in parallel by default and remembering to add locks wherever necessary, we run only one thread at a time, switching between threads only at explicitly marked points.</p>

<p>The two schemes have different failure modes. If you forget the locking in preemptive code, you get subtle bugs. If you forget to allow task switching in a cooperative system, the program may run slower (waiting when it could be getting on with something). For an application like 0install, cooperative makes far more sense. Just making downloads and GUI interaction alone concurrent is really all we need.</p>

<h3>Callbacks</h3>

<p>The simplest scheme to implement uses <em>callbacks</em>. You tell the system to start an operation, and give it a function to call on success:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">key_info_downloaded</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">info</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parse_key_info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">confirm_with_gui</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">feed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">info</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">trust_confirmed</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">trust_confirmed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Here, we don&#8217;t know what other functions may be called in the time between us calling <code>download_key_info</code> and the <code>key_info_downloaded</code> callback, but while our code is executing we know that we have complete control. For example, it&#8217;s not a problem if <code>parse_key_info</code> here only supports single threading.</p>

<p>Callbacks have two major problems:</p>

<ul>  <li>They make the code messy and hard to read.</li>
  <li>They handle exceptions poorly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine that <code>download_key_info</code> has succeeded. It calls the <code>key_info_downloaded</code> callback. That calls <code>parse_key_info</code>, which throws an exception. The exception gets returned to <code>download_key_info</code> which can&#8217;t do anything useful with it. Probably, it gets logged and the program hangs, waiting for a call to <code>trust_confirmed</code> that will never happen.</p>

<h3>Promises</h3>

<p><em>Promises</em> are a nice alternative to callbacks. When you start an operation, you get a <em>promise</em> for the result. A promise is a place-holder for a result that will arrive in the future. Without any special syntax, using promises might look something like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">confirmation_promise</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">confirm_with_gui</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">feed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">info</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">confirmation_promise</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">when_fulfilled</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">trust_confirmed</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">trust_confirmed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The function <code>promise.when_fulfilled(callback)</code> immediately returns a new promise for the (future) result of the callback.</p>

<p>Internally, a promise initially contains a queue for callbacks. When the promise is (eventually) resolved to a value, the callbacks are all run and the queue is replaced by the value. Attempting to attach any further callbacks just runs them immediately on the value.</p>

<p>Promises have a number of advantages over callbacks. For example, you can store promises of results in lists, pass them to other functions, etc. One particular advantage is exception handling. Consider our previous example:</p>

<ol>  <li><code>confirm_key</code> returns a promise for the result of <code>key_info_downloaded</code>.</li>
  <li><code>download_key_info</code> downloads the data successfully, fulfilling <code>data_promise</code>.</li>
  <li><code>key_info_downloaded</code> is called (it was attached to <code>data_promise</code> as a callback).</li>
  <li><code>parse_key_info</code> throws an exception, which is caught by the promise system.</li>
  <li>This &#8220;breaks&#8221; the promise returned by <code>confirm_key</code>.</li>
  <li>Whoever was waiting for <code>confirm_key</code> gets notified of the exception.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice that instead of propagating uncaught exceptions <em>backwards</em> (to <code>download_key_info</code>), we propagate them <em>forwards</em> (to whoever is waiting for the result). The result is that, as in synchronous programming, an exception is not lost just because someone in the chain doesn&#8217;t handle it.</p>

<p>A natural next step is to introduce some simpler syntax for this&#8230;</p>

<h3>OCaml Lwt</h3>

<p>OCaml provides a couple of libraries for handling promises - <a href="http://ocsigen.org/lwt/">Lwt</a> and <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/concurrent-programming-with-async.html">Jane Street&#8217;s Async</a>. I&#8217;ve only looked at Lwt, although they seem <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-parallel/2013-April/000000.html">fairly similar</a>.</p>

<p>The terminology I introduced above I learnt from E (which also has <a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/concurrency/refmech.html">sophisticated distributed promises</a>). I find the E terms more natural, but here&#8217;s a conversion table:</p>

<table class="table">  <thead>    <tr>      <th>E term</th>
      <th>Lwt term</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Promise</td>
      <td>Thread</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>Fulfilled promise</td>
      <td>Returned thread</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>Broken promise</td>
      <td>Failed thread</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>Unresolved promise</td>
      <td>Sleeping thread</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      <td>Resolver</td>
      <td>Waker</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In particular, while a Lwt thread is still working to produce a result, the thread is said to be &#8220;sleeping&#8221;, which I find rather awkward. A resolver/waker is the object used by the maker of the promise to resolve it.</p>

<p>Anyway, switching to OCaml and using Lwt without the syntax extensions, we get this:</p>

<p>Here, <code>Lwt.bind promise callback</code> is like our previous <code>promise.when_fulfilled(callback)</code>. Again, <code>confirm_key</code> returns a promise (thread) for the final result.</p>

<p>To make things more convenient, you can enable the Lwt syntax extension. This provides thread-aware alternatives to several built-in OCaml keywords:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>As if by magic, our asynchronous code now reads like the original synchronous code! <code>lwt</code> is the new way to do <code>Lwt.bind</code>, by analogy with the ordinary <code>let</code> construct. We just have to remember that we give up control between evaluating the right-hand side of the assignment (getting a thread/promise for the data) and assigning the actual data on the left-hand side. For example, another function might change a global variable while we&#8217;re waiting for the promise to resolve.</p>

<p><a href="http://ocsigen.org/lwt/api/Pa_lwt">The other short-cuts</a> are <code>try_lwt</code>, <code>for_lwt</code>, <code>while_lwt</code> and <code>match_lwt</code>, which do what you&#8217;d expect. As a bonus, <code>try_lwt</code> also adds a <code>finally</code> construct and <code>for_lwt</code> adds iteration over sequences - both are missing for the core OCaml language.</p>

<p>There are plenty of functions for combining or creating threads in various ways, including:</p>

<ul>  <li><code>let thread, waker = Lwt.wait ()</code> explicitly creates a promise and a resolver for it.</li>
  <li><code>Lwt.return value</code> evaluates to a returned thread, which is useful if something needs a thread type but you already have the value.</li>
  <li><code>Lwt.choose threads</code> waits until one of the given threads is ready.</li>
  <li><code>Lwt.join threads</code> returns a single thread that returns when all of the given threads have returned.</li>
  <li><code>Lwt_list.map_s fn items</code> applies <code>fn</code> to each item, waiting for the resulting thread to resolve before doing the next item.</li>
  <li><code>Lwt_list.map_p fn items</code> as above, but runs all the threads in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python generators</h3>

<p>Python has an unusual solution to the problem, using its <em>generator functions</em>.</p>

<p>A generator is any function which contains a <code>yield</code>. Running such a function gets you an iterator. Each time you ask for a value from the iterator, the generator runs until the next <code>yield</code> to produce the result. It is suspended until the next call. Generators were originally just an easy way to produce sequences, for example:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>However, this ability to suspend and resume functions is obviously useful for cooperative multi-threading too and, like many other people, I used them to create a such a system (back in 2004). The version used in the Python version of 0install was designed for Python 2.3, but since then Python has added many useful new features so I&#8217;ll describe the recent <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/">Tulip/asyncio</a> system rather than my own, even though I haven&#8217;t actually used it much.</p>

<p>The idea is that every time you need to wait, you yield the promise (&#8220;future&#8221; in Python terminology) you&#8217;re waiting for. When it&#8217;s ready, the scheduler will resume your generator function with the result:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Both systems (OCaml Lwt and Python generators) work very well in general. Here are some (slightly simplified) examples from 0install.</p>

<h3>Following a recipe</h3>

<p>Some downloads require collecting files from several places (e.g. an upstream tarball and some files to patch it with). We want to download the files in parallel, but execute the steps (e.g. unpacking downloads into the target directory) in series. My solution is that each download is a thread that performs the download and then returns a lazy thunk that applies it:</p>

<p>Note that we start unpacking as soon as possible; we only wait when the next thing to unpack isn&#8217;t downloaded yet.</p>

<p>This was my first attempt at a Python version with asyncio:</p>

<p>An interesting difference is that OCaml threads, once started, continue to run by themselves even if no-one is waiting for the result. When the OCaml code is waiting for the first download to complete, the other downloads are still going on. But if we <code>yield from</code> just the first download in Python, only that download makes progress. In the code above, therefore, the Python waits for all downloads to complete before it starts unpacking.</p>

<p>You can fix this by wrapping the future with <code>async</code>:</p>

<h3>Downloading with libcurl</h3>

<p>libcurl doesn&#8217;t provide Lwt support. However, it is thread-safe. We can therefore use the <code>Lwt_preemptive</code> module to run each download in a real operating system thread and get a promise for its completion. In addition, we use a <code>Lwt_pool</code> to keep up to two Curl connections per site (queuing further requests).</p>

<p>When it&#8217;s our turn to run, we also start a five second timer if the caller wanted to be notified if the download is slow. This is used when downloading the small XML metadata files so the mirror can be tried in parallel (for archives, we only try the mirror if the download actually fails).</p>

<p>The <code>download_in_thread</code> function also needs to send progress notifications to back to Lwt, which it does using <code>Lwt_preemptive.run_in_main</code>.</p>

<p>Update: note that recent versions of ocurl support Lwt directly.</p>

<p>Python provides the <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, which combines pooling and preemptive threading. This makes it a bit harder to start the timer (which should happen cooperatively), so we need to use <code>call_soon_threadsafe</code>, which is like Lwt&#8217;s <code>run_in_main</code>. Python doesn&#8217;t seem to provide a way to manage the HTTP connections with the pool - I guess you have to do that manually.</p>

<h3>Error handling in key look-ups</h3>

<p>Lwt does have a gotcha for error handling. Consider this code:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>If querying the key info server fails, we want to log the error but continue with the confirmation, just with an empty list of hints.</p>

<p>Something I really dislike is code that looks right, compiles without warnings, works when you test it, and then fails in the field. Unfortunately, this code does just that. Even if you unit-test the error case!</p>

<p>The bug occurs because we accidentally used <code>try</code> rather than <code>try_lwt</code>. <code>download_key_info</code> successfully returns a promise for the information, so the <code>with</code> clause isn&#8217;t triggered and we exit the try block. Then Lwt waits for the promise to resolve so it can set <code>data</code>.
When unit-testing, you&#8217;ll probably raise the test exception immediately and so the <code>with</code> block does get called.</p>

<p>By contrast, Python&#8217;s generators have no such problems:</p>

<p>The other Lwt constructs don&#8217;t have this problem because the type-system will detect the error (e.g. if you use <code>match</code> instead of <code>match_lwt</code>), but with <code>try</code> and <code>try_lwt</code> the type signatures are the same.</p>

<h3>Failing over to a mirror</h3>

<p>We start downloading each XML feed from its primary site, but trigger a timeout task if it takes too long.
The timeout starts a download from the mirror, which happens in parallel with the original download attempt.
We don&#8217;t want to start the timer immediately because the download might get queued due to the rate limiting code, so we just pass the <code>if_slow</code> trigger to the download system (see above).</p>

<p>Because we need to report intermediate results (e.g. we have downloaded a possibly-slightly-old version from the mirror), we return a pair of the new result and a promise for the next update (or <code>None</code> if this is the last). In a similar way, we return errors as a pair of the current error (e.g. &#8220;mirror failed&#8221;) and a promise for the other result.</p>

<p><code>Lwt.choose</code> selects the result of the first task from a list to resolve. When choosing between the primary and the mirror however we ignore the result and test explicitly, because we need to know which one it was.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m too lazy to translate this into modern Python, but I think it&#8217;s clear that a direct translation would be easy enough.</p>

<p>The main problem would be losing OCaml&#8217;s type checking, which ensures that we handle all the possible error conditions. I simplified the outcomes into just <code>ok</code> and <code>problem</code> above, but in the real code we also distinguish <code>replay_attack</code>, <code>aborted_by_user</code> and <code>no_trusted_keys</code>, and handle them differently. For example, a &#8220;replay attack&#8221; from the mirror (where the mirror gives us a version older than one we&#8217;ve already seen) is ignored, whereas it&#8217;s reported if it comes from the primary.</p>

<h2>Switches</h2>

<p>The <code>Lwt_switch</code> module provides a way to group a set of activities together so you can stop them all at once.
You create a switch and pass it to all the various setup functions you call.
When you&#8217;re done, call <code>Lwt_switch.turn_off</code> to kill everything.
For example, each download goes to a temporary file. To ensure they&#8217;re all deleted afterwards:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to attach whatever finalisation code you want to a switch, e.g.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">download</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">switch</span> <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">tmpfile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">make_temp_file</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="nn">Lwt_switch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add_hook</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="n">switch</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Unix</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">unlink</span> <span class="n">tmpfile</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="nn">Lwt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">return</span> <span class="bp">()</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="nn">Lwt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">return</span> <span class="n">tmpfile</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Then it doesn&#8217;t matter whether we download successfully, raise an exception inside of <code>download</code>, raise an exception after calling <code>download</code>, etc; the file always gets deleted.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is bad API design and I shouldn&#8217;t rely on <code>download</code>&#8217;s caller to clean up the file if <code>download</code> fails, but it does seem convenient. To avoid mistakes, I used <code>~switch</code> to force the caller to pass a switch instead of the more normal <code>?switch</code> (where use of a switch is optional).</p>

<h2>Parallel tasks</h2>

<p>Regular OCaml lets you assign multiple variables at once using <code>and</code>, so that all the expressions are evaluated in a context where none of them is bound. For example, to switch the names of two variables:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Lwt uses this syntax with <code>lwt</code> to create multiple tasks in parallel and then wait for all of them. For example, when we run a command we may want to collect the standard output and standard error separately but in parallel (if we did them in series, the process might get stuck trying to write its stderr while we were trying to read its stdout, if the Unix pipe gets full). With this syntax, we can get the two strings with just:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">lwt</span> <span class="n">stdout</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Lwt_io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">read</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">stdout</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">stderr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Lwt_io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">read</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">stderr</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>0install needs to manage several fairly complex concurrent download activities, including error handling, timeouts and mirrors. Cooperative multi-threading allows us to support this easily with a low risk of race conditions.</p>

<p>Python and OCaml both provide powerful and easy-to-use cooperative threading support. I think Python&#8217;s generators are slightly easier to understand for beginners, but I find both quite easy to use. I find Lwt&#8217;s terminology a little confusing, but thinking of threads as promises seems to help. Both systems handle exceptions sensibly.</p>

<p>Comparing Python and OCaml code, they&#8217;re pretty similar. Both make it easy to start and manage cooperative threads, to interact with pools of preemptively threaded code (e.g. libcurl) and to handle errors.
Using OCaml variants for network errors rather than exceptions is useful; this ensures that all such errors are handled. If you rely on exceptions instead then things mostly work, but watch out for using <code>try</code> rather than <code>try_lwt</code>.</p>

<p>The old 0install Python code used a custom system built on top of Python&#8217;s generators, but Python&#8217;s new asyncio module provides a standardised replacement (asyncio will be added to the standard library in Python 3.4). Lwt has been around for a while and is already available from Linux distribution repositories.</p>

<p>Lwt also integrates with several other libraries, including GTK, OBus (D-BUS bindings) and React. Lwt seems very reliable. The only bug I found in Lwt so far was <a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/20">a pipe read failure on Windows</a>, which they quickly fixed.</p>

Bootstrap (from 1.x to 2.x), after which I dutifully ignored all the fixes

using v2.0.2).  </p>

<p>For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I&#8217;ve been 
meaning to make this site &#8216;responsive&#8217; (read: not look like crap from a

<p>For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I&#8217;ve been 
meaning to make this site &#8216;responsive&#8217; (read: not look like crap from a 
mobile).  Bootstrap v3 purports to be mobile-first so upgrading would likely 
give me what I&#8217;m after but v3 is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">not backwards compatible</a>, 
meaning I&#8217;d have to rewrite parts of the HTML.  Since this step was 
unavoidable, it led me to have another look at front-end frameworks, just to 
see if I was missing anything.  This was especially relevant since we&#8217;d 
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">just released</a> the new <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a> 
website, itself built with Bootstrap v2.3.1 (we&#8217;d done the design/templating 
work long before v3 was released).  It would be useful to know what else is 
out there for any future work.</p>

<p>Around this time I discovered Zurb Foundation and also the numerous 
comparisons between them (note: Foundation seems to come out ahead in most 
of those).  A few days ago, the folks at Zurb released 
<a href="http://zurb.com/article/1280/foundation-5-blasts-off--2">version 5</a>, so I decided that now is the time to kick the 
tires.  For the last few days, I&#8217;ve been playing with the framework and in 
the end I decided to migrate my site over completely.  </p>

<h4>Swapping out one framework for another</h4>

<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve become moderately experienced with HTML/CSS and I can 
usually wrangle things to look the way I want, but my solutions aren&#8217;t 
necessarily elegant. I was initially concerned that I&#8217;d already munged 
things so much that changing anything would be a pain.  When I first put the 
styles for this site together, I had to spend quite a bit of time 
overwriting Bootstrap&#8217;s defaults so I was prepared for the same when using 
Foundation.  Turns out that I was fine.  I currently use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (and 
<a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>) so I only had three template files and a couple of 
HTML pages to edit and because I&#8217;d kept most of my custom CSS in a separate 
file, it was literally a case of swapping out one framework for another and 
bug-fixing from there onwards.  There&#8217;s definitely a lesson here in using 
automation as much as possible.</p>

<p>Customising the styles was another area of concern but I was pleasantly 
surprised to find I needed <em>less</em> customisation than with Bootstrap.  This 
is likely because I didn&#8217;t have to override as many defaults (and probably 
because I&#8217;ve learned more about CSS since then).  The one thing I seemed to 
be missing was a way to deal with code sections, so I just took what 
Bootstrap had and copied it in.  At some point I should revisit this.</p>

<p>It did take me a while to get my head around Foundation&#8217;s grid but it was 
worth it in the end.  The idea is that you should design for small screens 
first and then adjust things for larger screens as necessary. There are 
several different default sizes which inherit their properties from the size 
below, unless you explicitly override them.  I initially screwed this up by 
explicitly defining the grid using the <code>small-#</code> classes, which obviously 
looks ridiculous on small screens.  I fixed it by swapping out <code>small-#</code> for 
<code>medium-#</code> everywhere in the HTML, after which everything looked reasonable. 
Items flowed sensibly into a default column for the small screens and looked 
acceptable for larger screens and perfectly fine on desktops.  I could do 
more styling of the mobile view but I&#8217;d already achieved most of what I was 
after.  </p>

<h4>Fixing image galleries and embedded content</h4>

<p>The only additional thing I used from Bootstrap was the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel">Carousel</a>. I&#8217;d 
written some custom helper scripts that would take some images and 
thumbnails from a specified folder and produce clickable thumbnails with a 
slider underneath.  Foundation provides <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html">Orbit</a>, so I had to spend time 
rewriting my script to produce the necessary HTML.  This actually resulted 
in cleaner HTML and one of the features I wanted (the ability to link to a 
specific image) was available by default in Orbit.  At this point I also 
tried to make the output look better for the case where JavaScript is 
disabled (in essence, each image is just displayed as a list).  Below is an 
example of an image gallery, taken from a previous post, when I 
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/joined-the-computer-lab/">joined the computer lab</a>.</p>

<div class="gallery">  <noscript><small><em>Note: The gallery needs JavaScript but I've tried to make it degrade gracefully. -Amir</em></small></noscript>
  <ul class="inline-list">    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-1"><img alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-1" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-1.png" /></a></li>
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-2"><img alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-2" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-2.png" /></a></li>
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-3"><img alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-3" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-3.png" /></a></li>
    
  </ul>
  <ul data-options="next_on_click:true; timer_speed:3000; pause_on_hover:false; bullets:false;" data-orbit="">    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-1"><img alt="join-comp-lab-1" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-1.jpg" /></li>
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-2"><img alt="join-comp-lab-2" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-2.jpg" /></li>
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-3"><img alt="join-comp-lab-3" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-3.jpg" /></li>
    
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Foundation also provides a component called <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/flex_video.html">Flex Video</a>, which allows the 
browser to scale videos to the appropriate size.  This fix was as simple as 
going back through old posts and wrapping anything that was <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> in a 
<code>&lt;div class="flex-video"&gt;</code>.  It really was that simple and all the Vimeo and 
YouTube items scaled perfectly.  Here&#8217;s an example of a video from an 
earlier post, where I gave a <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">walkthrough of the ocaml.org site</a>. 
Try changing the width of your browser window to see it scale.</p>

<div class="flex-video widescreen vimeo">  <iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="303" mozallowfullscreen="true" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61768157?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=de9e6a" webkitallowfullscreen="true" width="540">Video demo</iframe>
</div>

<h4>Framework differences</h4>

<p>Another of the main difference between the two frameworks is that Bootstrap 
uses <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> to manage its CSS whereas Foundation uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a>.  Frankly, 
I&#8217;ve no experience with either of them so it makes little difference to me. 
It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind for anyone who&#8217;s workflow does involve 
pre-processing.  Also, Bootstrap is available under the 
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#license-faqs">Apache 2 License</a>, while Foundation is released under 
the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/faq.html#question-3">MIT license</a>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Overall, the transition was pretty painless and most of the time was spent 
getting familiar with the grid, hunting for docs/examples and trying to make 
the image gallery work the way I wanted.  I do think Bootstrap&#8217;s docs are 
better but Foundation&#8217;s aren&#8217;t bad.  </p>

<p>Although this isn&#8217;t meant to be a comparison, I much prefer Foundation to 
Bootstrap.  If you&#8217;re not sure which to use then I think the secret is in 
the names of the frameworks.  </p>

<ul>  <li>Bootstrap (for me) was a <em>great</em> way to &#8216;<em>bootstrap</em>&#8217; a site quickly with 
lots of acceptable defaults &#8211; it was quick to get started but took some 
work to alter.  </li>
  <li>Foundation seems to provide a great &#8216;<em>foundation</em>&#8217; on which to create more 
customised sites &#8211; it&#8217;s more flexible but needs more upfront thought.  </li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much how I&#8217;d recommend them to people now.</p>

<p>The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the OCaml ecosystem. It&#8217;s the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over the last several months and I&#8217;d specifically like to thank <a href="https://github.com/Chris00">Christophe</a>, <a href="http://ashishagarwal.org">Ashish</a> and <a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a> for their dedication (the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/commits/master">commit logs</a> speak volumes).  </p>

This led to a comprehensive set of <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">wireframes and walk-throughs</a> of the site, which then developed into a collection of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign">Photoshop mockups</a>.

In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style sheets, which we&#8217;ve adapted to fit our needs across the site.  </p>

<p>Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-July/000211.html">workflow we aspired to</a>, both as maintainers and contributors.  This led us to develop completely new tools for <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html">Markdown</a> and <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-35-12-using-mpp-two-different-ways.html">templating</a> in OCaml, which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all.  </p>

<p>Working on all these things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I&#8217;ll write about separately) but the result has been worth the effort.  </p>

<p><a href="http://ocaml.org"><img alt="OCaml.org" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-mockup.png" /></a></p>

<p>The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information on packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forward will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community become involved in the generation and curation of content.  This brings me to the second part of this post.</p>

<h3>Call for content</h3>

<p>We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could do with a refresh and gaps that could be filled.  As a community driven site, we need ongoing contributions to ensure that the site best reflects its members.  </p>

<p>For example, if you do commercial work on OCaml then maybe you&#8217;d like to add yourself to the <a href="http://ocaml.org/community/support.html">support page</a>? Perhaps there are tutorials you can help to complete, like <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html">99 problems</a>?  If you&#8217;re not sure where to begin, there are already a number of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?labels=content">content issues</a> you could contribute to.  </p>

<p>Although we&#8217;ve gone through a bug-hunt already, feedback on the site is still very welcome.  You can either <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues">create an issue</a> on the tracker (preferred), or email the infrastructure list. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s fantastic how far we&#8217;ve come and I look forward to the next phase!</p>

those bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.  This is the 
phase we&#8217;ll be in from <em>today</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we 
<strong>merge the redesign branch</strong> into the master branch.  This would 
effectively present the new site to the world.  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on 
the master branch but would be happy to accept them on the new, redesign 
branch.  Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.  </p>

<p>Please note that the above is only intended to merge the <em>design</em> and 
<em>toolchain</em> for the new site.  Specifically, we&#8217;ve created new landing 
pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site&#8217;s contents as 
well as made some new libraries (<a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html">OMD</a> and <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-39-07-OPAMaging-MPP.html">MPP</a>). The new toolchain 
means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a 
lot easier.  </p>

<p>Since the files are on GitHub, people don&#8217;t even need to clone the site 
locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the &#8216;Edit 
this page&#8217; link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the 
repository and GitHub&#8217;s editing and pull request features will allow you to 
make changes and submit updates, all from within your browser (see the 
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository">GitHub Article</a> for details).  </p>

<p>There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes 
are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed by 
the OCaml community and merged.</p>

<p><em>When</em>: 6pm, Wednesday 6th November</p>

<p><em>Who</em>: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.</p>

<p><em>What</em>: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals</p>

<p><em>Wiki</em>: <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki">https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</a></p>

<p>We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/libref/index.html">standard library</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html">runtime</a>, tools (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/depend.html">ocamldep</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc105">ocamllex</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc107">ocamlyacc</a>, etc.), <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-camlp4/manual002.html">camlp4</a>, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual032.html">ocamlbuild</a>, the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html">documentation</a>, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">mini-projects</a> for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6.30pm.</p>

Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial 
at the <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24">FPDays</a> conference (an event for people interested in Functional 
Programming).  <a href="https://github.com/yallop">Jeremy</a> and I led the session with <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David</a> and 
<a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a> helping everyone progress and dealing with questions.</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" />It turned out to be by far the <em>most popular session</em> at the conference with 
over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml!  An excellent turnout 
and a great indicator of the interest that&#8217;s out there, especially when you 
offer a hands-on session to people.  This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise as we&#8217;ve 
had good attendance for the general <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/">OCaml meetups</a> I&#8217;ve run 
and also the <a href="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html">compiler hacking sessions</a>, which Jeremy and 
Leo have been building up (do sign up if you&#8217;re interested in either of 
those!).  We had a nice surprise for attendees, which were 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof">uncorrected proof</a> copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just 
enough to go around.</p>

Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px" />It turned out to be by far the <em>most popular session</em> at the conference with 
over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml!  An excellent turnout 
and a great indicator of the interest that&#8217;s out there, especially when you

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof">uncorrected proof</a> copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just 
enough to go around.</p>

<p>For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises 
and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">skeleton repo</a> (with helpful comments in the code) so that people 
could dive in quickly.  The event was set up to be really informal and the 
rough plan was as following:</p>

<ol>  <li>    <p><em>Installation/Intro</em> - We checked that people had been able to follow the 
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-ocaml-session/">installation instructions</a>, which we&#8217;d sent them in advance. 
We also handed out copies of the book and made sure folks were comfortable 
with <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><em>Hello world</em> - A light intro to get people familiar with the OCaml 
syntax and installing packages with OPAM. This would also help people to get 
familiar with the toolchain, workflow and compilation.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><em>Monty Hall browser game</em> - Using <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"><code>js_of_ocaml</code></a>, we wanted 
people to create and run the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> in their 
browser.  This would give people a taste of some real world interaction by 
having to deal with the DOM and interfaces.  If folks did well, they could 
add code to keep logs of the game results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><em>Client-server game</em> - The previous game was all in the browser (so could 
be examined by players) so here the task was to split it into a client and 
server, ensuring the two stay in sync.  This would demonstrate the 
re-usability of the OCaml code already written and give people a feel for 
client server interactions. If people wanted to do more, they could use 
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/pkg/ctypes/0.1.1/">ctypes</a> and get better random numbers.  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We did manage to stick to the overall scheme as above and we think this is a 
great base from which to improve future tutorials.  It has the really nice 
benefit of having visual, interactive elements and the ability to run things 
both in the browser as well as on the server is a great way to show the 
versatility of OCaml.  <code>js_of_ocaml</code> is quite a mature tool and so it&#8217;s 
no surprise that it&#8217;s also used by companies such as Facebook (see the recent 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKWNjFagR9k">CUFP talk by Julien Verlaguet</a> - skip to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gKWNjFagR9k#t=1149">19:00</a>).  </p>

<p>We learned a lot from running this session so we&#8217;ve captured the good, the 
bad and the ugly below.  This is useful for anyone who&#8217;d like to run an 
OCaml tutorial in the future and also for us to be aware of the next 
time we do this.  I&#8217;ve incorporated the feedback from the attendees as well 
as our own thoughts.</p>

<p><img alt="Heads down and hands on" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-03.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Things we learnt</h3>

<h4>The Good</h4>

<ul>  <li>    <p>Most people really did follow the install instructions beforehand. This 
made things so much easier on the day as we didn&#8217;t have to worry about 
compile times and people getting bored.  A few people had even got in touch 
with me the night before to sort out installation problems.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Many folks from OCaml Labs also came over to help people, which meant 
no-one was waiting longer than around 10 seconds before getting help.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>We had a good plan of the things we wanted to cover but we were happy to 
be flexible and made it clear the aim was to get right into it.  Several 
folks told us that they really appreciated this loose (as opposed to rigid) 
structure.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>We didn&#8217;t spend any time lecturing the room but instead got people right 
into the code.  Having enough of a skeleton to get something interesting 
working was a big plus in this regard. People did progress from the early 
examples to the later ones fairly well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>We had a VM with the correct set up that we could log people into if they 
were having trouble locally.  Two people made use of this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Of course, It was great to have early proofs of the book and these were 
well-received.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="RWO books galore!" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-02.jpg" /></p>

<h4>The Bad</h4>

<ul>  <li>    <p>In our excitement to get right into the exercises, we didn&#8217;t really give 
an overview of OCaml and its benefits.  A few minutes at the beginning would 
be enough and it&#8217;s important so that people can leave with a few sound-bites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Not everyone received my email about installation, and certainly not the 
late arrivals.  This meant some pain getting things downloaded and running 
especially due to the wifi (see &#8216;Ugly&#8217; below).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>A few of the people who <em>had</em> installed, didn&#8217;t complete the instructions 
fully but didn&#8217;t realise this until the morning of the session.  There was a good 
suggestion about having some kind of test to run that would check 
everything, so you&#8217;d know if there was something missing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>We really should have had a cut-off where we told people to use VMs 
instead of fixing installation issues and 10-15 minutes would have been 
enough.  This would have been especially useful for the late-comers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>We didn&#8217;t really keep a record of the problems folks were having so we 
can&#8217;t now go back and fix underlying issues.  To be fair, this would have 
been a little awkward to do ad-hoc but in hindsight, it&#8217;s a good thing to 
plan for.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>The Ugly</h4>

<ul>  <li>The only ugly part was the wifi.  It turned out that the room itself was a 
bit of a dead-spot and that wasn&#8217;t helped by 30ish devices trying to connect 
to one access point!  Having everyone grab packages at the same time in the 
morning probably didn&#8217;t help.  It was especially tricky as all our 
mitigation plans seemed to revolve around at least having local connectivity.
In any case, this problem only lasted for the morning session and was a 
little better by the afternoon.  I&#8217;d definitely recommend a backup plan in 
the case of complete wifi failure next time!  One such plan that Leo got 
started on was to put the repository and other information onto a flash 
drive that could be shared with people.  We didn&#8217;t need this in the end but 
it&#8217;ll be useful to have something like this prepared for next time.  If 
anyone fancies donating a bunch of flash drives, I&#8217;ll happily receive them!</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, it was a great session and everyone left happy, having completed 
most of the tutorial (and with a book!).  A few even continued at home 
afterwards and <a href="https://twitter.com/richardclegg/status/393458073052139520">got in touch</a> to let us know that they got 
everything working.
It was a great session and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno">Mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacquiDDavidson">Jacqui</a> and the rest of 
the FPDays crew for a great conference!</p>

<a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, I&#8217;ll be running an OCaml Hands-on Session at 
the <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/">FPDays conference</a>. Below are some prep 
instructions for attendees.</p>

<h3>Preparation for the session</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re starting from scratch, installation can take some time so it&#8217;s 
best to get as much done in advance as possible.  You&#8217;ll need OPAM (the 
package manager), OCaml 4.01 (available through OPAM) and a few libraries 
before Thursday.  If you have any issues, please contact Amir.</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p><strong>OPAM</strong>: Follow the instructions for your platform at <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html">http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html</a>. 
OPAM requires OCaml so hopefully the relevant dependencies will kick in and 
you&#8217;ll get OCaml too (most likely version 3.12).  You can get a cup of 
coffee while you wait. After installation, run <code>opam init</code> to initialise OPAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p><strong>OCaml 4.01</strong>: We actually need the latest version of OCaml but OPAM 
makes this easy.  Just run the following (and get more coffee):</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>opam update

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="sb">`</span>opam config env<span class="sb">`</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>  <li><strong>Libraries</strong>: For the workshop you will need to check that you have the 
following installed: <code>libffi</code>, <code>pcre</code> and <code>pkg-config</code>.  This will depend on 
your platform so on a Mac with homebrew I would do 
<code>brew install libffi pcre pkg-config</code> or on Debian or Ubuntu 
<code>apt-get install libffi-dev</code>.  After this, two OCaml packages it&#8217;s worth 
installing in advance are <code>core</code> and <code>js_of_ocaml</code> so simply run:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>opam install core js_of_ocaml</code></pre></div>

<p>OPAM will take care of the dependencies and the rest we can get on the day!</p>

<h2>Removing ;;</h2>

<p>Looking back at my code, the most obvious &#8220;this is beginner code&#8221; clue is the use of <code>;;</code> everywhere. The <a href="http://ocaml.org/tutorials/structure_of_ocaml_programs.html">OCaml tutorial</a> gives a list of complicated rules for when to use <code>;;</code>, but in fact it&#8217;s very simple:</p>

<ul>  <li>Never use top-level expressions in an OCaml program.</li>
  <li>Never use <code>;;</code> (except when tracking down syntax errors).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Removing ;;</h2>

<p>Looking back at my code, the most obvious &#8220;this is beginner code&#8221; clue is the use of <code>;;</code> everywhere. The <a href="http://ocaml.org/tutorials/structure_of_ocaml_programs.html">OCaml tutorial</a> gives a list of complicated rules for when to use <code>;;</code>, but in fact it&#8217;s very simple:</p>

<ul>  <li>Never use top-level expressions in an OCaml program.</li>
  <li>Never use <code>;;</code> (except when tracking down syntax errors).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to run some code at startup (e.g. your &#8220;main&#8221; function), just put it inside a <code>let () = ...</code> block. That way you&#8217;ll also get a compile-time error if you miss an argument. I don&#8217;t know why OCaml even allows top-level expressions. e.g.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>In a similar way, I was a bit over cautious about adding parenthesis around expressions. For example, I had <code>Str.regexp ("...")</code> and <code>match (...) with</code>. They&#8217;re not needed in most cases.</p>

<h2>Warnings</h2>

<p>Always compile with warnings on. I don&#8217;t know why this isn&#8217;t the default. Use <code>-w A</code> to enable all warnings.</p>

<p>I actually use <code>-w A-4</code>, which disables the warning when you use a default match case. Default match cases should be avoided when possible, but if you&#8217;ve gone to the trouble of adding one then you probably needed it.</p>

<h2>Exhaustive matching</h2>

<p>One of the great strengths of OCaml (which I missed at first) is that it always makes you handle every possible case. Providing a catch-all case defeats this check. In my initial code, I needed to process a list of bindings. First, all the environment bindings, then all the executable ones. I made a <code>do_env_binding</code> function which applied environment bindings and ignored all others:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">do_env_binding</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">impls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">function</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">EnvironmentBinding</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">var_name</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">_</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I did the same for executable bindings. Then I applied them all like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="c">(* Do &lt;environment&gt; bindings *)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nn">List</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">do_env_binding</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">impls</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">bindings</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="c">(* Do &lt;executable-in-*&gt; bindings *)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nn">List</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">do_exec_binding</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">impls</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">bindings</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I now think this is bad style, because if a new binding type is added no compiler warning will appear. It&#8217;s better to have the functions accept only the single kind of binding they process. Then the code that calls them separates out the two types of binding. If a new type is added later, the code will issue a warning about an unmatched case:</p>

<h2>Handy operators</h2>

<p>The recently released OCaml 4.01 adds two new built-in operators, <code>@@</code> and <code>|&gt;</code>. They&#8217;re very simple, and you can define them yourself on older versions like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="o">(@@)</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="o">(|&gt;)</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>They both simply call a function with an argument. For example <code>print @@ "Hello"</code> is the same as <code>print "Hello"</code>. However, they are very low precedence, which means you can use them to avoid parenthesis. For example, these two lines are equivalent (we load a file, parse it as XML, parse the resulting document as a 0install selections document and then execute the selections):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">execute</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">parse_selections</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">parse_xml</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">load_file</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">)))</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">execute</span> <span class="o">@@</span> <span class="n">parse_selections</span> <span class="o">@@</span> <span class="n">parse_xml</span> <span class="o">@@</span> <span class="n">load_file</span> <span class="n">path</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The advantage here is that when you read an <code>(</code>, you have to scan along the rest of the line counting brackets to find the matching one. When you see <code>@@</code>, you know that the rest of the expression is a single argument to the previous function.</p>

<p>The pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code> is similar, but the function and argument go the other way around. These lines are equivalent:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">execute</span> <span class="o">@@</span> <span class="n">parse_selections</span> <span class="o">@@</span> <span class="n">parse_xml</span> <span class="o">@@</span> <span class="n">load_file</span> <span class="n">path</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">load_file</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">parse_xml</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">parse_selections</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">execute</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Intuitively, the result of each segment of the pipeline becomes the last argument to the next segment.</p>

<p>At first, I couldn&#8217;t see any reason for preferring one or the other, so I decided to use just <code>@@</code> initially (which was most familiar, being the same as Haskell&#8217;s <code>$</code> operator). That was a mistake. <code>|&gt;</code> is the more useful of the two.</p>

<p>In the original post, I complained that you had to write loops backwards, giving the loop body first and then the list to be looped-over. With <code>|&gt;</code>, that problem is solved:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">List</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="nn">Printf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">printf</span> <span class="s2">"Item: %s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="n">item</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Using the pipe operator eliminates the mismatch between the desire to make the function the last argument and OCaml&#8217;s common (but not universal) convention of putting the data structure last. It can also make things look more object-oriented, by putting the object first. Consider this code for setting an attribute on an XML element:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">set_attribute</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">c</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Which is the element, and which are the name and value? Written this way, it&#8217;s hopefully obvious that <code>c</code> is the element:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">set_attribute</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Sequences become clearer. For example, consider adding two items to a collection in order:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line">  <span class="c">(* Using () *)</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="o">(</span><span class="nn">Collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="n">items</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line">  <span class="c">(* Using |&gt; *)</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">items</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I was even considering changing the order of the arguments to my <code>starts_with</code> function to make it work with pipe. Currently, we have:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">starts_with</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>But does it check that <code>a</code> starts with <code>b</code> or the other way around? They&#8217;re both strings, so type checking won&#8217;t catch errors either. Reversing the arguments and using pipe, it would be clear:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">starts_with</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>However, <a href="http://ocaml-extlib.googlecode.com/svn/doc/apiref/ExtString.String.html">extlib&#8217;s version</a> uses the original order, so I decided not to change it. Also, I used it in a lot of places and I couldn&#8217;t find a semantic patching tool to change them all automatically (like Go&#8217;s <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt -r</a> or C&#8217;s <a href="http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/">Coccinelle</a> - which, interestingly, is written in OCaml).</p>

<h2>Handling option types</h2>

<p>I noted the lack of a null coalescing operator in my original code. I&#8217;ve now made some helpers for handling option types (I don&#8217;t know if OCaml programmers have standard names for these). I find them neater than using <code>match</code> statements.</p>

<p>The first I named <code>|?</code>. It&#8217;s used to get the value out of an option, or generate some default if it&#8217;s missing. It&#8217;s defined like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="o">(|?)</span> <span class="n">maybe</span> <span class="n">default</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">maybe</span> <span class="k">with</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">v</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">None</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Lazy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">force</span> <span class="n">default</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Using OCaml&#8217;s built-in <code>lazy</code> syntax makes this a bit nicer than having to define an anonymous function each time you use it. It&#8217;s used like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>The only slight issue I have is that if you forget the <code>lazy</code> when raising an exception then you don&#8217;t get a compile-time error. It just throws the exception in all cases. However, you should spot this problem quickly when you test it.</p>

<p>Another common task is to execute some code with the option&#8217;s value only if it&#8217;s set. I defined <code>if_some</code> for this. It takes a function to call with the value, but partial application means you usually don&#8217;t need to define one explicitly. For example, to stop a timer if you have one:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Finally, there&#8217;s a <code>pipe_some</code>, which is the same except that it maps <code>None -&gt; None</code> rather than <code>None -&gt; ()</code>.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>After spending a few months writing OCaml, my coding style hasn&#8217;t actually changed much since my first attempts right after reading the tutorials. I&#8217;m not sure whether this is good or bad. Like Python, there is a one-obvious-way-to-do-it feeling to OCaml, unlike Haskell and Perl, which somehow seem to encourage clever-but-incomprehensible solutions. When I&#8217;ve read other people&#8217;s OCaml code (e.g. Lwt), I haven&#8217;t found anything new or hard to read.</p>

<p>The main changes have been cosmetic: the removal of <code>;;</code>, fewer brackets, and the <code>|&gt;</code> operator to make the code tidier, plus some common helper functions. I&#8217;m also finding more ways to make the type system do more of the work: e.g. avoiding catch-all match cases and using <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/08/31/option-handling-with-ocaml-polymorphic-variants/">Polymorphic Variants</a>.</p>

<p>The most useful functions I&#8217;ve added (some borrowed from other people) are:</p>

<ul>  <li><code>|?</code> for handling <code>None</code> values (see above)</li>
  <li><code>if_some</code> and <code>pipe_some</code> (see above)</li>
  <li><code>finally_do</code> to work around the lack of a <code>try...finally</code> syntax in OCaml</li>
  <li><code>filter_map</code> (apply a function to each item in a list, filtering out any <code>None</code> replies)</li>
  <li><code>starts_with</code> (as in Python)</li>
  <li><code>abspath</code> and <code>realpath</code> (to resolve pathnames; translated from the Python standard library code)</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone else wants my <code>realpath</code>, it&#8217;s in <a href="https://github.com/0install/0install/blob/master/ocaml/support/utils.ml">Support.Utils</a>.</p>

<p>What other useful tips or utilities do people have?</p>

Yaron Minsky and I have been running OCaml tutorials for a few years at
<a href="http://icfpconference.org">ICFP</a> and <a href="http://cufp.org">CUFP</a>, but haven&#8217;t
really spread out into the wider conference circuit.  Now that <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World

<p>As a bonus, the Cambridge FPDays session will feature Jeremy Yallop working through
the book and conducting the tutorial: he has an incredible depth of knowledge
about the innards of OCaml&#8217;s type system, and so advanced users will also find
a good home in this tutorial to throw questions at him too!  For those of you
interested in other programming languages, there are also excellent-looking
sessions on Erlang, F# and Scala, and Phil Wadler is giving a keynote speech.
I&#8217;m most excited about <a href="http://fpdays.net/fpdays2013/sessions/index.php?session=28">Sam Aaron&#8217;s session</a>
on live coding and music though.  You have to hear it to believe it&#8230;</p>

In my <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html">previous post</a>
on Travis, I explained how it can be used to easily test OCaml packages on
GitHub without having to host any infrastructure yourself.</p>

<p>The next step I wanted to investigate was how to use Travis to trigger service deployments
after a successful build.  One nice feature that Travis has is <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/encryption-keys/">support for
encrypted environment variables</a>. The basic workflow is that you encrypt
key/value pairs using a public key that they publish per GitHub repository.
Once registered, this is made available as a decrypted environment variable
within the Travis worker.  You can use this to transmit API keys or other
authentication data that you need to commit to the <code>travis.yml</code> file, but
obviously can&#8217;t leave on a public repository for the world to see.</p>

<p>The small hitch with this whole scheme is that there&#8217;s a very small limit
of about 90 bytes or so for the size of each individual environment variable
that&#8217;s exported, and so you can&#8217;t just stash an SSH private key in there.

Instead, it needs to be Base64 encoded, split it up into multiple environment
variables of the right size, and then reassembled within the Travis VM.  Rather
than deal with importable shell scripts between MacOS X and Linux, I created
a small <code>travis-senv</code> command-line binary to make this easier.</p>

<p>To use it, just <code>opam install travis-senv</code> and follow the instructions on the
<a href="https://github.com/avsm/travis-senv">README at the homepage</a>.  Here&#8217;s the
fragment of shell script that pushes the build output to another GitHub
repository:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using this to automate the construction of the <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage Xen unikernel</a>

retrieve an SSH deployment key using <code>travis-senv</code>, and push the results of the
build to the
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www-deployment">mirage-www-deployment</a>
repository that stores the build output.  This repository is polled by the
hosting machines we have to look for new kernels and rotate the website (but
more on this later &#8211; I&#8217;m just integrating the EC2 and Rackspace scripts to

<h2>Trying it out</h2>

<p>Read the excellent instructions at the <a href="https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch">Merlin for Vim from scratch</a> wiki page.  A few immediately useful things I did are below.</p>

<p><em>Displaying types:</em> You can get the local type of something by typing in <code>\t</code> anywhere.  This is the <code>&lt;LocalLeader&gt;</code> for anyone who has customized their setup (it is mapped to backslash by default).</p>

<p><em>Tab completing functions:</em> You can tab-complete module signatures by pressing <code>Ctrl-X-O</code> (make sure you keep Ctrl pressed the whole time).  This activates vim&#8217;s OmniComplete mode.  To get this to work with your external projects, create a <code>.merlin</code> file.  I use this for <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns">ocaml-dns</a> for example.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">PKG lwt cstruct
S lib
S lib_test
S lwt
B _build/lib
B _build/lib_test
B _build/lwt</code></pre></div>

<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to pass the <code>-bin-annot</code> function to the compiler to
generate the typed-AST <code>cmt</code> files.  You can add <code>true: bin_annot</code> to your
<code>_tags</code> file if you&#8217;re using OCamlbuild (in OCaml 4.01.0 or higher, and
it&#8217;ll be silently ignored on previous versions so you don&#8217;t need to worry
about breaking older OCaml compilers).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Attendee introductions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danielle&#160;</strong>(missed her last name, is from Switzerland): did a PhD on anomaly detection and then worked at Swiss banks on security monitoring. The key challenges in the area are around the nature of the questions we need to ask about all the data that we have access to.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Brewer:</strong> coordinator of the IT as a Utility network which is funding all this. &#160;Interested in the next steps: both immediate and the overall vision and direction it's all going. &#160;Concrete actions emphasised.</p>
<p><strong>Ian Brown:</strong> Oxford University and cybersecurity. Interested broadly in these issues and also has a degree in psychology and behavioural psychology. &#160;The challenge is how to balance the "engineering" (this isnt fundamental computer science) and understand why there is so little takeup of this.</p>
<p><strong>Amir Chaudhry:</strong> working on a toolstack for the Internet of Things. &#160;When we have tweeting toasters, how do we make it all useful to people. It's not the raw data, but the insights we present back to people to make it useful.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Churchill:</strong> was at Yahoo, now at eBay Research. &#160;Right now the challenge I'm facing is personalisation, and is trying to understand why the models they have of people are rubbush (this is why so much advertising isnt very useful). &#160;The reasoning processes and data <em>quality</em> is important. &#160;We are making assertions about people based on data they have gathered for another purpose, and the ethical and business issues are important. Has been pushing on : what the data source, what is the data quality, and are these assertions based off data thats appropriate, and how can we design new algorithms"</p>
<p><strong>Jon Crowcroft:</strong> from the Computer Lab in Cambridge and does anything to do with communication systems, and leads the Horizon project with Mort and PAWS which is working on wifi access in disadvantaged areas. Also working on Nymote. &#160;Is interested in new human/data rights vs t&amp;cs. &#160;Rights and duties are encoded in terms and conditions (badly) -- see Latier's latest book about this, and see how poor Amazon's recommendations are. &#160;We're interested in building a technology where you own your own data but business practises all gel together. &#160;We had a workshop at how the EU is pushing the right to be forgotten, so how can we ensure that data can be removed including all references. &#160;People go "its too difficult", but this isn't true -- takedowns work, and why is it that only big corporations can afford to take down stuff. &#160;The right to oblivion ("not be there in the first place") and data shouldn't be a public good but people should have the right to be in a paid avoidance zones. (See Shockwave Rider by Brunner, 30 years old, loads of great technical ideas, and Future Shock is a good read too). &#160;Can we shift regulatory positions and have</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Dedis:</strong> runs Fab Lab in Barcelona. &#160;Cofounder of Smart Citizen, crowdfunded environment sensing platform based on a piece of hardware based on Arduino. &#160;Allows people to capture data in their own homes, and push it to an online platform. &#160;Allows people to push it in a 'conscious' way? Go to smartcitizen.me to see the data platform. &#160;Intended to grow into other places, but capturing air pollution, humidity, temperature and other environment data. &#160;Main thing is that you own your own data. &#160;Much cheaper than the competition too and crowdfunding.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Dittus</strong> (@dekstop) is a PhD student at UCL and works on cities.io. Thousands of people mapping the planet in incredibly detailed ways and it works with both commercial and non-commercial stuff. What makes these systems work, what are the processes to coordinate things, questions of data quality and how to assert stuff over it? &#160;Used to be part of the last.fm data team which is about personal data gathering and detailed profiling that users themselves put up.</p>
<p><strong>Christos Efstratiou:</strong> as of September is a lecturer at University of Kent (and is still a visiting research at Cambridge). &#160;Works on sensing, more broadly that has to do with people and sensors in the environment and embedded sensing in the environment. &#160;Privacy is a huge issue and is his key challenge. &#160;This isn't sensing in the old style like Active Badge -- back then, people werent aware of the issues and nowadays, people are more aware of privacy. &#160;So the challenge is the evolving user perceptions and how our system design works. &#160;Anecdote: at a recent wedding he was at, there was a request from the &#160;bride/groom to note post any public photos to Twitter/Facebook. We've lost control over our public personas.</p>
<p><strong>Julie Freeman:</strong> an actual resident in this building and the art associate for the ODI space! &#160;Is a PhD student at QMW and is interested in echoing other people. &#160;Interested in physical manifestations of digital data, and how we can "step away from the screen". &#160;Broad interests in transformation of digital data.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Grimpe:</strong> from Oxford and is a sociologist in an interdisciplinary EU project on "Governance for Responsible Innovation". &#160;They have a network notion of responsibility which takes into account that a lot of data production and data use takes place in networks that posses strong ties between people. &#160;She started two cases studies in two area: telecare technologies for elderly people (relevant due to the EU Horizon 2020 societal challenge in aging and wellbeing due to the demographic change in western societies, and this brings the ethical issue around the use of personal data at scale); there is difficulty of informed consent due to dementia also. The other case study is completely different and is about financial market technology and the data is highly commercially sensitive, so understanding how transparency can be balanced against financial control and the need for genuine market secrets to facilitate trade.</p>
<p><strong>Wifak Gueddana</strong> is a postdoc at information systems group at LSE. &#160;Did her PhD on open source communities and how open source can work for NGOs and grass roots. &#160;Working on a research project for online platforms -- how to use computational analytics to collect and process data and deal with the qualitative and subjective issues.</p>
<p><strong>Hamed Haddadi:</strong> lecturer in QMUL, asking how we can compute over mobile data and has worked on advertising and privacy aware system systems. &#160;Linking the temporal nature of the data and understanding how much of your data is exposed (amusing anecdote about wearing shorts)</p>
<p><strong>Muki Haklay:</strong> professor of GIScience and the Extreme Citizen Science group. He's interested in participatory citizen science and cyberscience. &#160;Interested in GeoWeb and mobiile GeoWeb technologies and understanding how tools for voluntary participation work (open street map, participatory geoweb). &#160;"How can you give control to people that are not technical" and how do we build protocols for cultural sensitivity? &#160;Working on Open Street Map, while its easy for techies to contribute and feel happy, it might be an issue from a privacy perspective without GPS fuzzing or pseudonyms (you can say "I know where you live" to every OSM user). (discussion about most data being rubbish and is a psychology question about whether this depresses people!)</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Harding:</strong> from the Ordnance Survey who control most of the UK's mapping data and is a principal scientist in the research team team on working on how people interact with geography in business, public service and leisure. &#160;Moving beyond just GPS into the connective function about what's going on in places, and the connection between different objects and places. &#160;What is the purpose for needing all this connected information, and how can the Ordnance Survey better serve its users with such <em>usable</em>&#160;connected data? &#160;She commissions internal and external research and this includes PhDs and postdocs. &#160;Challenge for this workshop: how personal data relates to location and the different levels of granularity at which such relationships can be made -- beyond GPS, there is address data in (e.g.) supermarket loyalty cards, and other data at a postcode level, and different types of geographies all have connections. &#160;Understanding provenance of data is really really important .</p>
<p><strong>Pat Healey:&#160;</strong>Professor of Human Interaction and head of cognitive science research group and workson health issues. &#160;Not here yet so introduced by Hamed.</p>
<p><strong>Tristan Henderson;&#160;</strong>lecturer in compsci at St Andrews in Scotland, did his PhD on first person shooter games and runs a widely used mobile data set called CRAWDAD. They archive and share it and so work a lot on redistribution of data. His undergrad was economics so his interest is on behavioural aspects and usability issues too (Tristan has recently joined the HCI group and the ethics committee at St Andrews). &#160;How can we get researchers to further engage with the ethics process and to refine the notions of informed consent in electronic terms. &#160;Challenges: what is acceptable HDI and are we conducting it in an acceptable way (q from Mort: how broad? a: everything). &#160;And is HDI unique enough that we might need another term.</p>
<p><strong>Laura James:&#160;</strong>from OKF (not here yet)</p>
<p><strong>Helene&#160;Lambrix:&#160;</strong>visiting LSE and usually at Paris-Dauphine University in France and is hoping to finish her PhD this year! Interested in corporate reputation and social media.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Lathia:&#160;</strong>researcher at Cambridge University and did his PhD on online recommender systems. Noticed a disparity between data services online and the offline word so started working on recommender systems for urban systems (banging head against TFL data). &#160;At Cambridge, started working with psychologists and leads EmotionSense (how satisfied are you with your life, as well as ongoing smartphone sensor data) -- its really popular. &#160;Challenges: language issue around how we present issue and motivate people around using that data (how does using EmotionSense affect their behavior)</p>
<p><strong>Panos</strong> from Brunel: interested in cybersecurity and intelligence from media data mining and cloud based work. Commodification process of digital economy data and what is the legal frameowork surrounding this. &#160;What are the personas for data to apply frameworks and data mining techniques to it? &#160;Challenges: regulatory system using big personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong> from University of Nottingham and has just submitted PhD and waiting viva. Background is political science and internationl relations, and is interested in informed consent and how we sustain consent rather than just secure it as a one-off. The challenges: the human bit and how we communicate the complexity of systems and how people can make meaningful decisions. If you want people to be engaged with process then we need data to be more social and human.</p>
<p><strong>Ursula Martin</strong>: professor in a Russel Group university in Mile End road. Is a mathematician and is researching the production of mathematics, and how it happens in the first place. Producing maths is a slow, painstaking thing, and is wondering how the rate of production can keep up with our needs. When interacting with an outfit getting her data, she's not just an isolate, but is actually part of a large complex system.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Mortier "mort"</strong>: From Nottingham and is the dude running this workshop so has introed before!</p>
<p><strong>Nora Ni Loideain:&#160;</strong>doing a PhD in the european data protection and this requires the mandatory retention of data by telecomms provider. References recent US events cf Snowden and her PhD is on privacy oversight and the guards (or lack thereof) in current frameworks. &#160;Challenges: how can we build these safeguards and what is the nature of informed consent with these.</p>
<p><strong>Ernima Ochu:&#160;</strong>based in Manchester. Sometimes an activist, sometimes a writer, sometimes an artist. Background in neuroscience! &#160;The social life of data and what happens around it, and how people get around based on it.</p>
<p><strong>Yvonne Rogers</strong> and is from team UCL and is director of UCLIC (Interaction Center) and also an Intel-funded institute at UCL where they work on connected data. &#160;Given lots of data from sources, interested in how people can engage with it and how to visualise . (Hamed: "Human City Interaction is the next thing!")</p>
<p><strong>Geetanjali Sampemane;</strong>&#160;background in Computer Science, and works at Google on Infrastructure Security and Privacy group. &#160;Challenge is how to help people calibrate the benefits and risks for appropriate tradeoffs. &#160;How can humans make an informed choice, and this isn't based on informed choice. &#160;Giving people buttons and options isn't the most useful way to approach this, and we need a mental model similar to how we judge risks in the physical world. &#160;In the online world, noone understands how dangerous it is to reuse passwords. Security people have made is a little worse by telling people to use complicated passwords, but brute force isn't the big problem right now, it's the connectivity of services.</p>
<p><strong>Cerys Willoughby:&#160;</strong>Southhampton and looking at the usability of notebooks and wondering how to make the interfaces usable without being a technological guru. (missed rest due to reading cool comic she projected about her work. Sorry!)</p>
<p><strong>Eiko Yoneki</strong>: from Cambridge, and she works on digital epidemiology and real world mobility data collection in Africa (e.g. EipPhone). &#160;She analyses network structure to understand graphs and connectivity. &#160;Also works on CDNs and builds self-adaptive CDNs, and works on graph-specific data parallel algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Cave:&#160;</strong>game theorist (Yale, Cambridge, Stanford) and worked in a lot of government/academia/research areas. Works on economics and IoT (festival of things and the boundaries of humanity is coming up soon in Cambridge on 29th October). &#160;Fascinating anecdote about price of sick animals</p>
<p><strong>George Danezis:</strong> formerly MSR now UCL, and is interested in technical security aspects of how to glue together distributed mobile devices and not leave our personal data unreadable. &#160;Has done work on privacy friendly statistics and how we can process and analyse it as an aggregate data set. Has worked in the context of smart metering in Europe.</p>
<h2>Breakout sessions</h2>
<p>We then had breakout sessions to brainstorm the challenges in this area (lots of post it notes and arguments), and Amir Chaudhry has summarised the results of the 5 presentations here:</p>
<p><strong>Disambiguating data.</strong> For example from the home and organisations. This isn't a new problem but becomes more important the more data collection occurs using different sources. &#160;Who are the principles in terms of onwership and provenance? &#160;How do we deal with communities/groups &#160;and data control?</p>
<p>Why not try crowd sourcing mechanisms for people to use so that they can improve the use of sites like Ryanair (who deliberately obfuscate things). &#160;Changing mindset from consumer perspective to a producer perspective. &#160;i.e humans make data and perhaps can provide this to others for economic benefits.</p>
<p>We have data and different notions of data quality. &#160;It's not always the case that the most scientific data is the best, depending on how it's used. &#160;We have Collectivist notions of data culture: e.g this conversation right now in the room isn't just individual, it's all of us so we can't ascribe it to individuals. Then there are Network notions, based on transactions that use a reductionist view to decide what they're worth. &#160;Can think of these on a continuum and the research challenge is how well do different ends of above scale in producing data and making value. &#160;Interesting question is if people opt out (right to forget or right to oblivion), then the data that is left is flawed.</p>
<p>We need to examine current assumptions and values around data. &#160;What is the unit of analysis? Must be clearer on this. Where and when we look at what data also matters as well as global aggregation. &#160;Sometimes also want to look at trajectories and data flows and how this changes over time. &#160;How do we interact with this data. &#160;Do users interact with data directly or with something that sits in front of it? &#160;There's an interaction between data science and the creative process of presenting information in a certain way. &#160;This depends on ultimate goal being served, for example e.g beavioural changes or just increased engagement.</p>
<p>There are big challenges in integration of groups who want to construct humans. Groups like social sciences (think about risk), Psychological science (reputation), Data sciences (Epistomology and Ontology), Design science (Interfaces and interactions). What is the new meaning of ownership and liability? e.g who owns this collection of posters and the ideas that have come out? [Hamed and Mort clarify that it's all theirs!] &#160;What happens if there are negative consequences as a result of using poor data?</p>
<p>Business models are also important in order to go from studies to practice. Are there new social structures we could make to help this? &#160;For example, we have venture capital that takes risks but what about social capital to spread risk to create new businesses e.g kickstarter and the like.</p>
<p>What does informed consent mean? Current system puts onus on user to understand all the contractual conditions before deciding. &#160;Perhaps there's a social-network method of crowd-sourcing opinions on ToS or providing some kind of health rating? &#160;Perhaps data protection agencies could certify terms or maybe the EFF or non-profits can provide some kind of rating system (c.f Moody's etc?). For example from the home and organisations. This isn't a new problem but becomes more important the more data collection occurs using different sources. &#160;Who are the principles in terms of onwership and provenance? &#160;How do we deal with communities/groups &#160;and data control?</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Ian Brown took notes on our breakout session on business models for privacy:</p>
<p>Collectives/cooperatives sharing data through PDSes</p>
<ul><li>How to incentivise membership? Dividends, social benefit (e.g. medical research)</li>
<li>what currently exists where data controller has strong incentive not to leak/breach data e.g. Boots for brand loyalty, Apple/Facebook? So long as customer can switch effectively (portability, erasure)</li>
<li>Power tool sharing at village level. Hang off existing structures e.g. local councils.</li>
<li>New forms of micro-markets e.g. physical gatherings? Alternatives to currencies. Kickstarter? Distribution reduces risk of centralised architectures.</li>
<li>What do syndicalist-anarchist models of data management look like?</li>
<li>Current uses of data are optimising existing business practices. But what totally new practices could be enabled? Human-facing efficiencies?</li>
</ul>
<p>What are types of biz models? Startups, personal profit, NGO, medical research, banks. Balanced investment portfolio.</p>

A few months ago, Mike Lin posted <a href="http://blog.mlin.net/2013/02/testing-ocaml-projects-on-travis-ci.html">instructions</a> of how to bootstrap an OCaml testing environment within the <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> continuous integration tool.  I finally got around to integrating his prototype scripts properly using the latest OCaml and OPAM versions during my travels last week to ICFP.

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Getting my first Travis build working with one of my OCaml projects took about 2 minutes in total:</p>

<p>First, log into <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis</a> and sign in via Twitter.

A few months ago, Mike Lin posted <a href="http://blog.mlin.net/2013/02/testing-ocaml-projects-on-travis-ci.html">instructions</a> of how to bootstrap an OCaml testing environment within the <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> continuous integration tool.  I finally got around to integrating his prototype scripts properly using the latest OCaml and OPAM versions during my travels last week to ICFP.  It&#8217;s been an extraordinarily quick and pleasant experience to add the (free!) Travis test runs to my OCaml programs on GitHub, so here&#8217;s how you can do it too.  <a href="http://dave.recoil.org">Dave Scott</a> and I have used this for about 15 of our own projects already, and I&#8217;m switching the whole of the <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> repo infrastructure over to it this week.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Getting my first Travis build working with one of my OCaml projects took about 2 minutes in total:</p>

<p>First, log into <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis</a> and sign in via Twitter.  Click on the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile">Accounts</a> button on the top-right and you should see a list of the all the GitHub repositories that you have access to.  Just click the <i>On</i> switch for the one you want to start testing.  Nothing will actually happen until the next code push or pull request goes to that repository.  Behind the scenes, the <i>On</i> button that you clicked use the GitHub APIs to turn on the Travis post-commit hook for your repository.</p>

<p>Create a <code>.travis.yml</code> file in your main repository (see below or <a href="https://gist.github.com/avsm/6757425">this gist</a>).  Travis doesn&#8217;t have native support for OCaml, but it isn&#8217;t really needed since we can just use <code>C</code> and write our own shell scripts.  The <code>env</code> variables define a matrix of the different combinations of OCaml and OPAM that we want to test.  Just remove variations that you don&#8217;t care about to avoid wasting Travis&#8217; CPU time (open source projects are supported on a fair-use basis by them).
Here&#8217;s the <code>.travis.yml</code> that I used for my <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-uri">ocaml-uri</a> library: </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">language</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">c</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">bash -ex .travis-ci.sh</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">env</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">OCAML_VERSION=4.01.0 OPAM_VERSION=1.0.0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">OCAML_VERSION=4.01.0 OPAM_VERSION=1.1.0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">OCAML_VERSION=4.00.1 OPAM_VERSION=1.0.0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">OCAML_VERSION=4.00.1 OPAM_VERSION=1.1.0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">OCAML_VERSION=3.12.1 OPAM_VERSION=1.0.0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">OCAML_VERSION=3.12.1 OPAM_VERSION=1.1.0</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now you just need the <code>.travis-ci.sh</code> shell to run the actual tests.  Travis provides an Ubuntu Precise/i386 VM that is destroyed after every test run, so we need to initialize it with the OCaml and OPAM binary packages.  Since you often want to test different versions of all of these, I created a series of stable Ubuntu PPAs that have OCaml 3.12,4.0,4.1 and OPAM 1.0 and the (currently beta) 1.1 package manager.  You can find them all on my <a href="http://launchpad.net/~avsm">Launchpad</a> page, but the below script takes care of it all for you.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="c"># Edit this for your own project dependencies</span>

<p>Now just do a push to your repository (a commit adding the Travis files above will do), and you will soon see the Travis web interface update.  For example, here&#8217;s the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-uri/builds/11899338">output of ocaml-uri</a> that the above example files are for.  Of course, you should tweak the scripts to run the tests that your own project needs.  Let me know if you make any useful modifications too, by forking the <a href="https://gist.github.com/avsm/6757425">gist</a> or e-mailing me.</p>

<h2>Testing pull requests in OPAM</h2>

<p>Travis isn&#8217;t just for code pushes though; as of a few months ago it can also <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/announcing-pull-request-support/">test pull requests</a>.  This is an incredibly useful feature for complex projects such as the OPAM repository that has lots of contributors.  You don&#8217;t need to do anything special to activate it: whenever someone issues a pull request, Travis will merge it locally and trigger the test runs just as if the code had been pushed directly.</p>

<p>I did do some special scripting to make this work with the OPAM package repository.  Ideally, every new package or metadata change in OPAM will attempt to rebuild just that package set (rebuilding the entire repository would far exceed the 50 minute testing budget that Travis imposes).  I put together a <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/blob/master/.travis-ci.sh">very hacked up shell script</a> that greps the incoming diff and rebuilds the subset of packages.  This is now live, and you can see both <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/1144">successful</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/1131">failed</a> pull requests (once the request has been merged, there&#8217;s a tiny little green arrow beside the commit that was tested).</p>

<p>This is a very unconservative estimate test matrix since a package update will also affect the reverse transitive cone of packages that depend on it, but it does catch several common typos and incompatibilities (for example, packages that use OPAM 1.1-only features by mistake).  The longer term plan is to use the <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/ocamlot">OCamlot</a> command line tool to parse the pull request and compute an exact set of packages that need rebuilding.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/303/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png" style="padding-left: 15px; float:right;" width="250px" /></a>
Travis has one last very cool feature up its sleeve.  When a project has successfully built, it can run a scripting hook in the VM, which can be used to trigger a further code push or service update.  If the service requires authentication, you can <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/encryption-keys/">encrypt a secret</a> in the <code>travis.yml</code> using their public key, and it will be available in the VM as an environment variable (but won&#8217;t be useful to anyone else looking at the code repository).</p>

<p>There are quite a few uses for these Travis deployment scripts: automating the rebuilding of the <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> website infrastructure, rebuilding the central <a href="http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-24-01-50-14-opamdoc-take1.html">opam-doc</a> <code>cmt</code> file archive, or even autoupdating <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> microkernels to Amazon EC2 and Rackspace.</p>

<p>So how does this tie into the ongoing work on <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/09/ocamlot-autotriaging.html">OCamlot</a>?  Quite simply, it&#8217;s saved us a ton of frontend work, and lets us focus on the more interesting OCaml-specific problems.  Travis is also somewhat reactive (since it only runs in response to pushes or pull requests), and we still need to be able to run complete repository sweeps to look for more systematic breakage. It also doesn&#8217;t support any non-Ubuntu operating systems yet.  However, Travis takes the burden off us for handling the steadily <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/20/opam-1-1-beta.html">increasing</a> number of package updates, and can be used to launch further OCamlot jobs on the other architectures and distributions.  All in all, I&#8217;m very grateful to Mike for taking the trouble to blog about it back in March!</p>

<h2>And a little bit of cheeky ARM hackery</h2>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t resist one final little hack to see if I could actually do some ARM/OCaml testing using the Travis infrastructure.  I adapted Ian Campbell&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.hellion.org.uk/blog/posts/foreign-chroots-with-schroot-and-qemu/">guide to ARM cross-chroots</a>, and ended up with a <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml/blob/travis/.travis-ci.sh">rough script</a> that builds an unattended chroot and can run OCaml/OPAM installations there too.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m quite comfortable running on all of my repositories just yet though, since an OCaml cross-build using qemu took over 5 hours and was quite rightly terminated when running within Travis.  To mitigate this, I&#8217;ve built a <a href="http://www.recoil.org/~avsm/debian-arm">custom apt-repository</a> for ARMel packages to install a binary toolchain, and you can see the results of <a href="https://travis-ci.org/avsm/ocaml/jobs/11942786">Lwt/ARM building successfully</a>.  I&#8217;ll update on this as I get it working on more packages, as I&#8217;m quite interested in getting a solid Xen/ARM toolstack up and running for another <a href="http://nymote.org">exciting project</a> over in OCaml Labs&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try explaining things in the opposite order to the official tutorial, starting with objects and adding classes later, as I think it&#8217;s clearer that way. Classes introduce a number of complications which are not present without them.</p>

<h2>Creating objects</h2>

<p>In Python, you create a single object by first defining a class and then creating an instance of it. In OCaml, you can just create an instance directly (Java can do this with <em>anonymous classes</em>).</p>

<p>For example, 0install code that interacts with the system (e.g. getting the current time, reading files, etc) does so by calling methods on a <code>system</code> object. For unit-testing, we pass mock system objects, while when running normally we pass a singleton object which interacts with the real system. We can define the singleton like this (simplified):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">real_system</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">object</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">time</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Unix</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">time</span> <span class="bp">()</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">exit</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">exit</span> <span class="n">code</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Note that the <code>exit</code> method is calling the built-in <code>exit</code> function, not recursively calling itself. Calling a method has to be explicit, as in Python.</p>

<p>To call a method, OCaml uses <code>#</code> rather than <code>.</code>:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="nn">Printf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">printf</span> <span class="s2">"It is now %f</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="n">real_system</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">time</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Initially, I defined time as <code>method time () = Unix.time ()</code>, but this isn&#8217;t necessary. Unlike for regular function definitions, the body of a method is evaluated each time it is called, even if it takes no arguments, not once when the object is created.</p>

<h2>Object types</h2>

<p>OCaml will automatically infer the type of <code>real_system</code> as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt; exit : int -&gt; 'a; time : float &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(note: <code>exit</code> never returns, so it can be used anywhere, which is why it gets the generic return type <code>'a</code>)</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a class (nor even a <em>class type</em>). It&#8217;s just a type.</p>

<p>Any object providing these two methods will be compatible with <code>real_system</code>. There is no need to declare that you implement the interface.</p>

<p>You also don&#8217;t need to declare the type when using the object. For example:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">exit_with_error</span> <span class="n">system</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">system</span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">exit</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">exit_with_error</span> <span class="n">real_system</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>However, the automatic inference will often fail. In particular, if a method is defined with optional arguments then it will be incompatible:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>In a similar way, using labelled arguments will fail unless you use them in the same order everywhere. To avoid these problems, it seems best to define the type explicitly:</p>

<p>As in Python, <code>self</code> is explicit. However, it&#8217;s attached to the object rather than to each method, and you can leave it out if you don&#8217;t need it. I added it here in order to constrain its type to <code>system</code>. I used <code>_self</code> rather than <code>self</code> to avoid the compiler warning about unused variables.</p>

<h3>A puzzle</h3>

<p>It seems to me that some object types can be inferred but not defined. Consider this interactive session:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>However, we can&#8217;t actually use the type it prints:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>You can define this type:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="o">#</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">lengther</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="kt">list</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">;;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>But that&#8217;s a different (and less useful) type:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what causes these problems. You can, however, use the cast operator (<code>:&gt;</code>) to convert to the required type if it happens.</p>

<p>Update: <code>x</code> does have a type, but it&#8217;s polymorphic: <code>'a lengther</code>. OCaml has cleverly noticed that I don&#8217;t actually store any <code>'a</code> values in the object, so it allows this single object to handle multiple types. For most objects, this will not be the case (for example, a mutable stack object could be an <code>int stack</code> or a <code>string stack</code>, but not both). For details, see my later post <a href="http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/12/20/polymorphism-for-beginners/">Polymorphism for beginners</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating many objects</h2>

<p>Usually, you&#8217;ll want to create many objects, sharing the same code. For example, when one 0install program depends on another, it may specify restrictions on the acceptable versions. Here&#8217;s how we make <code>version_restriction</code> objects to represent this (simplified):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">make_version_restriction</span> <span class="n">expr</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Versions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">parse_expr</span> <span class="n">expr</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">object</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">meets_restriction</span> <span class="n">impl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="n">impl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">version</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">to_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"version "</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">expr</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This is not a class. It&#8217;s just a function that creates objects.
It&#8217;s used like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">python2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">make_version_restriction</span> <span class="s2">"2..!3"</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">python33_plus</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">make_version_restriction</span> <span class="s2">"3.3.."</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Notice the <code>test</code> variable, which is like a private field in Java. It cannot be used from anywhere else, simply because it is not in scope. You can define functions here in the same way. OCaml does not allow accessing an object&#8217;s fields from outside (e.g. <code>restriction.expr</code> in Java or Python), but you can make a field readable by writing a trivial getter for it. e.g. to expose <code>expr</code>:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3>Casting</h3>

<p>You can cast to a compatible (more restricted) type using <code>:&gt;</code>. e.g.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">printable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">to_string</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="n">print</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">python2</span> <span class="o">:&gt;</span> <span class="n">printable</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>However, OCaml does not store the type information at runtime, so you cannot cast in the other direction. That is, given a <code>printable</code> object, you cannot find out whether it really has a <code>meets_restriction</code> method. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be a problem, since the places where I wanted to check for several possibilities were better handled with variants.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>OK, so we can create objects with public methods, constructors, internal functions and state, and define types (interfaces). So what are classes for? The key seems to be this: <strong>Classes are all about (implementation) inheritance.</strong> If you don&#8217;t need inheritance, then you don&#8217;t need classes.</p>

<p>Changing <code>make_version_restriction</code> to a class would look like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">version_restriction</span> <span class="n">expr</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">Versions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">parse_expr</span> <span class="n">expr</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">object</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">meets_restriction</span> <span class="n">impl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="n">impl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">version</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">to_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"version "</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">expr</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class="line"></span><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">python2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">version_restriction</span> <span class="s2">"2..!3"</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We just changed the <code>let</code> to <code>class</code> and <code>make_version_restriction</code> to <code>new version_restriction</code> (in fact, there are some syntax restrictions when defining classes: a class body is a series of <code>let</code> declarations followed by an object, whereas a function body is an arbitrary expression).</p>

<p>When you define a class (e.g. <code>version_restriction</code>), OCaml automatically defines three other things:</p>

<ul>  <li>a class type (<code>version_restriction</code>)</li>
  <li>an object type (also called <code>version_restriction</code>), defining the public methods</li>
  <li>an object type for subtypes (<code>#version_restriction</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The object type just defines the public methods provided by instances of the class. The class type also defines the API the class provides to its subclasses. Confusingly, OCaml calls this the &#8220;private&#8221; API (Java uses the term &#8220;protected&#8221; for this).</p>

<p>You can use <code>method private</code> to declare a method that is only available to subclasses, and <code>val</code> to declare fields (fields are always private). Methods can be declared as <code>virtual</code> if they must be defined in subclasses (this is like <code>abstract</code> in Java). A class with virtual methods must itself be virtual.</p>

<h3>Using inheritance</h3>

<p>To inherit from a class, use:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line">  <span class="k">object</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">inherit</span> <span class="n">superclass</span> <span class="n">args</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">super</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example from 0install: a <code>distribution</code> object provides access to the platform-specific package manager, allowing 0install to query the native package database for additional candidates. Each distribution subclasses the base class. Here&#8217;s my first (wrong) attempt to do this with classes (simplified):</p>

<p>The Python code in 0install maintains a cache of the dpkg database for quick access. The OCaml can query this cache, but can&#8217;t (currently) update it, so if the cache is out-of-date then it must fall back to the Python code.</p>

<p>This code doesn&#8217;t compile:</p>

<pre><code>("super" in "super#is_installed package")
Error: This expression has no method is_installed
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re used to other languages, you may have assumed, like me, that <code>class python_fallback_distribution : distribution</code> means
&#8220;<code>python_fallback_distribution</code> extends <code>distribution</code>&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t. It means that the class type of <code>python_fallback_distribution</code> is identical to that of <code>distribution</code>. Therefore, <code>python_distribution</code> can&#8217;t see the <code>is_installed</code> method, since it was virtual in <code>distribution</code>.</p>

<p>The solution here is simple: remove the <code>: distribution</code> bits.</p>

<p>In fact, we don&#8217;t need a class for <code>debian_distribution</code> at all: a simple object would do (we can still inherit, we just can&#8217;t let others inherit from us):</p>

<p>Notice that we declare the type of the object as <code>#distribution</code>, ensuring that this is a subtype of it. For a plain object (like this), we could also use just <code>distribution</code>, which would prevent us from adding any extra methods. When defining a class, you&#8217;d get an error if you did that, because restricting the type to <code>distribution</code> would prevent subclassing in some cases (e.g. adding additional methods). For some reason, if you don&#8217;t declare a type at all then it defaults to something strange that sometimes causes confusing errors at compile time.</p>

<h3>Problems with classes</h3>

<p>Using classes causes a few extra problems. For example, this object</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">nat_classifier</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">object</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">classify</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">zero</span>
</span><span class="line">      <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">positive</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>has type</p>

<pre><code>&lt; classify : int -&gt; [&gt; `positive | `zero ] &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you try to turn it into a class, you get:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Some type variables are unbound in this type:
     class nat_classifier :
       object method classify : int -&gt; [&gt; `positive | `zero ] end
   The method classify has type int -&gt; ([&gt; `positive | `zero ] as 'a)
   where 'a is unbound
</code></pre>

<p><s>OCaml can see that this method only returns `positive` or `zero`, but that may be too restrictive for subclasses. e.g. an `int_classifier` subclass may wish to return `positive`, `negative` or `zero`. So you&#8217;ll need to declare the types explicitly in these cases.</s></p>

<p>Update: Sorry, the above is nonsense (as pointed out in the comments). You&#8217;ll get the same error if you just try to name the type:</p>

<pre><code># type t =  &lt; classify : int -&gt; [&gt; `positive | `zero ] &gt;;;
Error: A type variable is unbound in this type declaration.
In method classify: int -&gt; ([&gt; `positive | `zero ] as 'a)
the variable 'a is unbound
</code></pre>

<p>The type of the plain object is polymorphic (because it contains a <code>&gt;</code>, which indicates a (hidden) type variable). This allows it to adapt in certain ways. For example: if you had some code that expected to be given the type <code>[`positive | `negative | `zero]</code> then our object would be compatible with that too (although it would never actually return <code>negative</code>, of course).</p>

<p>To fix it, we can either specify a closed (non-polymorphic) return type:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">6</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Or we can list the type variable explicitly (allowing it to remain polymorphic):</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Another example:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">object</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">method</span> <span class="n">read_with</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="n">file_contents</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>has type</p>

<pre><code> &lt; read_with : (in_channel -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e. it passes the open file to the given callback function and returns whatever that returns)</p>

<p>But if you try to use a class, you&#8217;ll get:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Some type variables are unbound in this type:
         class file : object method read_with : (in_channel -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a end
       The method read_with has type (in_channel -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a where 'a
       is unbound
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you need to give the type explicitly in this case. Here, we probably want to use &#8220;universal quantification&#8221; to make the class non-polymorphic:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The answer to Stack Overflow&#8217;s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10779283/when-should-objects-be-used-in-ocaml">When should objects be used in OCaml?</a> starts:</p>

<blockquote>  <p>As a general rule of thumb, don&#8217;t use objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the OCaml standard library doesn&#8217;t appear to use objects at all.</p>

<p>However, they can be quite useful. In 0install, we use them to abstract over different kinds of restriction (version restrictions, OS restrictions, distribution restrictions), different platform package managers (Arch, Debian, OS X, Windows, etc), and to control access to the system, using <code>real_system</code>, <code>dryrun_system</code> (which wraps a system, forwarding read operations but just logging writes, for <code>--dry-run</code> mode), and <code>fake_system</code> for unit-testing.</p>

<p>The main things to remember are that:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>You often need to declare types explicitly, as the automatic type inference often can&#8217;t infer the type, or infers an incompatible type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Classes and class types are about inheritance (the API exposed to subclasses), while object types are about the public API.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are still some things I&#8217;m not sure about:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>Is there any disadvantage to using plain objects rather than classes (when inheritance isn&#8217;t needed)? Is it considered good style to use classes everywhere, as the tutorial does?</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>When declaring argument types, whether to use <code>(system:system)</code> (I need a <code>system</code> object) or <code>(system:#system)</code> (the type of objects from subclasses of <code>system</code>). In general, I don&#8217;t understand why we need separate types for these concepts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessing and using weather data in OCaml</h2>

<p>He started with OCaml in graduate school and was looking for something better than Python, whereas they are building systems that need to run for many years with high stability. &#160;He's not from a formal CS background but from the physical sciences, and found that the static typing made it easy to explore the language features. &#160;The native code output is also important, and he finds predictability very important in day-to-day engineering. &#160;The simple FFI also made a big difference.</p>
<p>They do weather data retrieval and use HTTP/zeromq as a message bus to do language interop, and a workflow management tool to handle dependency graphs. &#160;They take weather models frmo all these sources, and do various analyses (principal component analysis, probability models for precipitation via Monte Carlo simulations with a first order Markov chains). &#160;More generally, there is a bunch of processing for climatology and data extraction and insertion.</p>
<p>A NAM forecast plots the geo data of the USA, and overlays semitransparent layers (e.g. clouds) that are stacked up to get a fake satellite view of the earth, and then there are simulated radar returns where the model (e.g.) rains. &#160;In addition to the structured formats, there is raw streaming data from sensor stations that send back raw binary data such as precipitation events, which is written as a small OCaml library to parses them into more structured formats.</p>
<p>The big data formats are HDF4 and GRIB, which are binary data formats. There are mature C libraries to parse them and lots of existing analysis tools (e.g. wgrib which can extract lat/longs from a big file). &#160;However, the tools arent great for doing larger scale analysis, as shelling out all the time for thousands of points is not ideal -- therefore they bind to OCaml to do the analysis in-house.</p>
<p>The GRIB bindings use int, float and float arrays and bindings are entirely hand-written &lt;i&gt;(I'm looking forward to the ctypes talk! --anil)&lt;/i&gt;. &#160;They expose only an OCaml friendly interface that is safe for callers. &#160;The speaker now shows several nice graphs from CloudSat tracks from earth orbit, and how they take intersecting profiles to deduce things about what multiple satellites are seeing.</p>
<p>They're mixing lots of different tools and satellite sources -- derived information from teleconnections (air surface pressure and how it varies in terms of oscillations between the north and south Atlantic). &#160;All the analysis is written in OCaml, and he had to work with several scientists who didn't have access to their initial source code in many cases, so the experience of working with his fresh system was very positive.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<ul><li>standard issues when interfacing with C (type mismatches between C and OCaml in particular, and the question of sharing vs copying). &#160;The worst failure mode is silent failure with bad data, which leads to bad science!</li>
<li>"Getting used to the functional way of life" can tough, as is knowing when to balance elegance with the speed benefits of not copying hundreds of megabytes of data around can be tough.</li>
<li>Development environments other than Emacs and Vim are poorly supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall project has been very successful, and the bindings for HDF4/GRIB API bindings have been used to process 1TB+/day for over 5 years now. &#160;It's based on Bigarray and mmap, and the FFI makes getting up and running quickly.</p>
<p>He finds OPAM with local repositories fantastic, and used GODI and odb/oasis-db before that.</p>
<p>Q: how did he do the cool plots?</p>
<p>A: plplot bindings on github</p>
<p>Q: Anil: did you move from Fortran</p>
<p>Q: Nate Foster: terabytes of data makes me wonder about GC?</p>
<p>A: going through and folding over data generates huge amount of garbage and slows things down considerably. If the project is one-off, he tweaks the GC or manually call the GC more often. Really depends on length of code.</p>
<p>Q: The data processed is huge, so what was the parallel computation approach?</p>
<p>A: The task distribution system doesn't need a lot of parallelism, as he can work on one file at a time or chunk the files manually and aggregate the results. &#160;He's looking forward to doing some semi-shared memory parallelism.</p>
<p>Q: Pierre Chambart: Is the numerical code in OCaml or C?</p>
<p>A: LAPACK in OCaml, but the Monte Carlo is pure OCaml and interpolation is in pure OCaml too. &#160;Unless speed is absolutely required, it's written in OCaml.</p>
<h2>Frenetic Network Controller</h2>
<p>Arjun Guha about their multiyear project to program software define networks. When he started on this, he thought that networks are just a series of tubes! The reality is very different though, as there are numerous intermediate boxes (firewalls, routers, wireless auth). The real problem is that each of these intermediate boxes runs specialized, vendor-specific software and are configured independently via some proprietary CLI. They're difficult to configure and difficult to statically reason about.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo13-e1380031705305.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1480" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo13-e1380031705305-225x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>SDN helps with this by introducing standardized programmable that can deploy in-network features, and a logically centralized controller (a big beefy server) that enables reasoning about whole-network behaviour. SDN is a hot topic right now (lots of commercial startups, 200+ people at HotSDN, generally very busy).</p>
<p>There are several Openflow controllers out there: Java (Floodlight), Python (Pox), C++ (Nox) and Haskell (Nettle), but Arjun introduces a novel OCaml programmable switch!</p>
<p>Openflow works via a controller "faulting" in new packets that are routed to the controller when unknown packets show up on the wire. The source code consists of a generic Openflow packet parser (its a binary protocol), and a generic packet parser (e.g. TCP/IP) and a routing engine.</p>
<p>First library: ocaml-packet that deals with deserializing TCP/IP/ARP/ICMP/Ethernet/802.1Q, and only depends on cstruct by Anil et al. (shows an example of a C struct for IPv4), and the nice thing that they get network byte order for free (thanks to Pierre Chambarts ocplib-endian of course).</p>
<p>ocaml-openflow uses serialization for OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.3, and is based on a (cleaned up) fork of the mirage-openflow library, using ideas from Nettle about to structure the code. OpenFlow 1.3 is less complete currently but is still quite usable.</p>
<p>The runtime systems for OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.3 listens for TCP connections from switches, and does the OpenFlow handles and keeps connections to switches alive.</p>
<p>The source code uses Lwt and so exposes the monad to external users, e.g.:</p>
<pre>type t
val connect : Lwt_unix.file_descr -&gt; t option Lwt.t</pre>
<p>They have a tutorial for non-OCaml hackers, and found teaching OCaml, Openflow AND Lwt was too much for new users. Therefore they built a new controller called Ox that hides much of the details of Lwt threading. It still uses them internally (Lwt, ocaml-openflow) but is inspired by Ox.</p>
<p>Therefore they can build simple openflow tutorials using Ox, and advanced controller such as Frenetic can be built directly using the low level libraries. Good for beginners and weathered OCaml hackers alike!</p>
<p>The problem with the controller seeing every bit of data is that it gets flooded by packets if it doesnt insert rules into the switches itself. Every switch has a <i>flow table</i> that has priorities, patterns and actions, and tries to take action without bothering the controller. At start of day, the controller does see everything, but eventually flows settle down. The problem they are solving is avoiding having two copies of the program on both the controller and the switch, and figuring out how to deal with race conditions across the two. The simple, logical structure of the OCaml program gets torn apart if they try to write these two parallel logic rules by hand.</p>
<p>They deal with this in the Frenetic network controller. This is a DSL for programming OpenFlow networks, and it has boolean predicates, several policy composition operations and compiles to OF flow rules. It implements ideas from several papers (ICFP/POPL/SIGCOMM/PLDI) and is fully open source on GitHub. (frenetic-lang/frenetic).</p>
<p>They made a transition from Haskell to OCaml for a few reasons. They specified several parts of the Core compiler and runtime in Coq, and found Haskell/Coq extraction very painful (specifically, they had to abandon Coq functors, which had helped them discover key algebraic properties for their work on Kleene algebras). They found it easier for their collaborators to use OCaml than Haskell in general too.</p>
<p>Lwt programming is mind boggling for beginners although the syntax extension does help, and the lack of multicore is a future problem as the controller needs scale up. Overall, they find that hacks at any layer are possible now and lots of projects have spun up!</p>
<p>Q: multicore is a common criticism, but could you give an example of how you would actually solve this is you had shared memory vs a fork model?<br />A: There are several networking algorithms in the literature, and its a barrier for consumers. Nate notes that they could write one by hand but there's a time issue there and would rather have it automagically.</p>
<h2>PHP Program analysis at Facebook</h2>
<p>Pffff is all about deadcode removal, test coverage, checking for undefined function and use of undeclared variables, and syntactical grep rules. They also do taint analysis via abstract interpretation, type driven flow control and eventually (via Monoidics) a separation logic model (they use OCaml too).<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo11-e1380048991412.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1478" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo11-e1380048991412-225x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This talk is about static analysis of a huge codebase (5m lines+ of PHP code is scary!). Since he had a lot of big monitors, he built the tools to do analysis over huge codebases. He demonstrates this on the OCaml compiler itself <i>(camlp4 is huge! boo!!! -anil)</i>. They can also zoom in in realtime to each box and eventually see the content of the file itself!</p>
<p>The goal is NOT to build an editor, but to analyse and explore large code bases. It opens and editor if required any time. The idea is to transform semantic program analysis into a visual formt that's more easily digestible. Just like in Google Maps where you see the big important roads and only the details when you zoom in. He uses this tool all day on his own codebase too, and gradually realised that when you want to learn a new codebase, you want to start to learn the software architecture first, and then want to figure out the dependency graph before seeing details.</p>
<p>He then shows an interactive grid map that explains the dependencies of whole subdirectories of the OCaml compiler, and drill down to understand what they're for.</p>
<p>Audience q: did you consider a flare graph? a: others have done edge graphs and graphviz etc, and none of these scale to quite the heights that this particular grid done. The ordering of the grid is also the transitive order of dependencies, so it starts with the list of simple dependencies (stdlib) and ends with the toplevel (depends on everything). You can spot for example the OCaml dev rule that things in stdlib are only used by the compiler.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo14-e1380031776990.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1481" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo14-e1380031776990-225x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>With good software, the top right of the grid is full, which is forbidden by OCaml (no cyclic module deps). With other software, the situation is far worse (audience laughter).</p>
<p>There are many other tools (CodeQuery, stags, sgrep/spatch and scheck). &#160;There are plugins for PHP, OCaml (using the cmt options) and Java (using Joust), C/C++ (using clang) getting all the semantic information from varied source code. &#160;There is a plan to move it to the web (from a GTK interface) by using Ocsigen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Conclusion: CodeMap is a scalable semantic source code vis/searcher for huge codebases, and codeGraph visualizes dependencies. &#160; Future work is to minimize backward deps.</p>
<p>All on Github at github.com/facebook/pfff.git</p>
<p>Q: can you insert other metadata such as Linux perf output?</p>
<p>A: yes! (I think)</p>
<h2>Extension points: an alternative to camlp4</h2>
<p>Leo White talking about alternatives to camlp4. Why? Camlp4 is very complex and it comes due to its support for an extensible grammar. Did a wg-camlp4 working group to figure out how to evolve common uses towards a more easily parsed standard, to reduce the day-to-day dependency on camlp4. After 400 emails, a consensum emerged.</p>
<p>sexplib as an example: the old version was</p>
<pre>type t = {
  float: int default(42);
  bar: float;
} with sexp</pre>
<p>The annotated version is:</p>
<pre>type t = {
  foo: int; [@default 42]
  bar: float
} [@@sexp]</pre>
<p>This has annotation data that is passed straight through to a transformer, with no extensions to the grammar. Thus the sexplib transformer can understand with @default 42 means, and editors can easily hide or fold annotations without having to understand their details precisely.</p>
<p>The compiler ignores any AST extension fragments that remain after all the transformers are done.</p>
<p>sedlex</p>
<pre>[%lexer
  match foo with
  (Range ('a','z') | Range(1000,1500)), 65 -&gt; Foo
  | Star (Range('a','z')) -&gt; Bar
]</pre>
<p>These are genuine AST nodes and so if these aren't handled by the transformer, an error will result. Another example is</p>
<p>properly foreign syntax, via COW (Caml on the Web)</p>
<pre>let world = "world" in
let html =  [%html {|&lt;h1&gt;Hello $str:world$!&lt;/h1&gt;
|}]</pre>
<p>There's also a shortcut convention for the syntax, such as:</p>
<pre>match%lexer foo with
 {|</pre>
<p>There's a shorthand form to avoid have lots of brackets due to deeply nested lets.</p>
<pre>[%lwt let x = f () in
[%lwt let y = g () in</pre>
<p>These have all been implemented by Alain Frisch and merged onto trunk (in OCaml 4.02.0dev). Thoughts and feedback are very welcome on the wg-camlp4 list</p>
<p>Q: how does this affect the quality of error messages?<br />A: Leo -- do you mean error messages from the extension itself?<br />Q: what if there is an error in the extension?<br />A: The 42 that was in the default has an AST fragment and so the transformer will transplant the location. A sensible transformer will therefore be nonlossy.</p>
<p>Q: can you chain transforms?<br />A: yes, thats why we are going with an AST fragment rather than a string, so chaining is easier. If youve got some macro expansion transformer and you want to use it with the sedlex example, they are executed in the other they are given on the command line. The next transformer will just see the resulting AST fragment, and therefore should compose between than camlp4 extensions have in the past.</p>
<p>Q: do you have ideas about hygiene as Scheme does?<br />A: Not particularly in this case, although Leo has some ideas for future systems.</p>
<p>Q: Ashish Agarwal -- do existing extensions need to be reimplemented<br />A: Good thing about all these existing extensions is that they have an existing parser, so you can take your existing implementation in camlp4 and mechanically translate into an extension_points version!</p>
<p>Q: Yaron: is anyone thinking about good libraries (hygiene etc)<br />A: Alain Frisch has merged in ppxtools into OPAM stable (that depends on 4.02.0+)</p>
<p>Q: Will this improve performance over camlp4<br />A: Parsing is an expensive process and this is still doing marshalling. The cost is often the case that we are shelling out to this other process, so we still need to look into improving performance in other ways.</p>
<h2>GPGPU programming with SPOC</h2>
<p>M Bourgoin presents his PhD work on SPOC.</p>
<p>GPGPU is odd hardware: several mutiprocessors, dedicated memory, connected via PCI-E and transferred between a GPU and host using DMA. Currently hardware has 300-2000 cores vs 4-16 CPU cores (wow). However this demands a very specific progamming model to take advantage of all this hardware.</p>
<p>Shows an example of a vector addition in openCL</p>
<pre>__kernel vac_add(global const double *c, global const double *a, global double *b, int N)
int nIndex = get_global_id(0);
if (nIndex &gt;= N)
  return;
c[nIndex] = a[nIndex] + b[nIndex]</pre>
<p>To actually use this though, you need a massive program to set up the kernel and execute it. It does the transforms, initialization, scheduling and so forth.</p>
<p>OCaml and GPGPU complement each other, since we have sequential high-level OCaml and highly parallel and low-level GPGPU. So the idea with SPOC is to use OCaml to develop high level abstractions in the GPGPU and program it from OCaml.</p>
<p>SPOC is a stream processing engine in OCaml that emits Cuda but lets it be more hardware independent.</p>
<pre>let dev = Devices.init ()
let n = 100000
let v1 = Vector.create Vector.float64 in
let v2 = Vector.create Vector.float64 in
let v3 = Vector.create Vector.float64 in

let k = vector_add (v1,v2,v3,n)
let block = {blockX = 1024; blockY=1; blockZ=1}
let grid={gridx=(n+1024-1)/1024; gridY=1; gridZ=1}

let main()=
random_fill v1;
random_fill v2;
Kernel.run k  (block,grid) dev.(0);
#printf of result</pre>
<p>SPOC takes care of transferring the kernel to the GPU and back and handling the scheduling and exchange of data. Vectors are very similar to Bigarrays in that they are external memory.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo15-e1380048240290.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1493" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo15-e1380048240290-224x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We want: simple to express, predictable performance and extensible libraries, and for current high performance libraries to be usable more safely.</p>
<p>Two solutions: interop with Cuda/OpenCL kernel (better perf and more compatible but less safe). There is also a DSL in OCaml called Sarek, which talk focusses on.</p>
<p>Sarek vector addition has an ML like syntax, and the language features monomorphic, imperative, toplevel and statically typed checked (with type inference). Its statically compiled to OCaml code and dynamic compilation to Cuda and OpenCL.</p>
<p>SPOC+Sarek achieves 80% of hand-tuned Fortran performance and SPOC+external kernels is on par with Fortran (93%). It's type safe, 30% code reduction, memory managed by the GC and there are fewer memory transfers. This is ready for the real world and has great performance! Available on OPAM.</p>
<p>Great performance, portable, great for GPU and for multicore CPU and nice playground for future abstractions.<br />Who can benefit?</p>
<p>OCaml programmers -&gt; better performance<br />HPC programmers -&gt; much more flexible and extensible than current state of the art.</p>
<p>Future work: Sarek needs custom types, function decls, recursions, exceptions, and to build parallel skeletons using SPOC and Sarek.</p>
<p>Why not use Sarek for multicore? Well, here's the results!</p>
<ul><li>ParMap: data parallel and similar to OCaml mapfold</li>
<li>OC4MC: posix threads, compatible with current OCaml code</li>
<li>SPOC : GPGPU kernels on a CPU, mainly data parallel and needs OpenCL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple program to calculate power series and matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>Power: OCaml 11s14, Parmap 3s30 SPOC &lt;1s<br />Matmul: OCaml 85s OC4MC 28s and SPOC 6.2s</p>
<p>Significant improvements using SPOC -- 11x for power series and 12x for SPOC. Running on a quad core intel i7.</p>
<p>SPOC is available via OPAM and compatible with x86_64 on Linux and MacOS X, and speaker would love feedback.</p>
<p>Q: Anil - how hard is OpenCL to install<br />A: easy if you know your hardware model and to the vendor website. Harder with multiple GPUs though.</p>
<p>A: if you want to target CPUs, you need to target OpenCL and not CUDA.</p>
<h2>High level performance optimisations for OCaml</h2>
<p>Pierre Chambart at OCamlPro (funded by Jane Street). OCaml is fast, but not an optimizing compiler (it has predictable performance, good generated code, but what can we do to make it go faster?).</p>
<p>A small modification to high level code shouldnt influence the low level bits.</p>
<pre>let f x = 
  let cmp = x &gt; 3 in
  if cmp then A else B

let g x =
  if x &gt; 3 then A else B</pre>
<p>The second bit of code is faster than the first here since 'g' is spotted by the compiler peephole optimizer.</p>
<pre>let g x = 
  let f v = x + v in
  f 3</pre>
<p>Abstract code should be compiled less abstractly. Above, we want to inline f, but a closure is still allocated per call unnecessarily. But we also dont want the compiler to be too smart and lose predictability!<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo16-e1380048580650.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1496" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo16-e1380048580650-225x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Currently compiler pipeline has a parsetree - typed tree - lambda (untyped) - clambda (lambda+closures) - cmm (simple C like) and then mach (instruction graph similar to llvm) and then lin (assembly like).</p>
<p>Details: typed tree to lambda (construct elimination) - lambda (high level simplication such as reference elimination and pattern matching generation) - lambda to clambda (inlining, constrant propagation and book keeping in an intricate recursive loop) - clambda to cmm (unboxing, lots of peep hole checks for boxing/unboxing and tagging/untagging) - cmm to mach (instruction selection and some more peephole) - mach (allocation fusion, register allocation and scheduling)</p>
<p>Where do we do high level optimizations then? For example, where do we do inlining (since it allows other transformations to apply). typedtree is too complicate, lambda (want inlining, simpler with closures), clambda (is too difficult to improve, and Pierre did try) and cmm (good for local optimization but not global) and mach is architecture specific.</p>
<p>They are adding a new intermediate form between lambda and clambda known as flambda. This needs a highlevel view of values, simple manipulations, explicit closures and explicit value dependencies. lambda to flambda introduces closures, and flambda to clambda is mainly book keeping (and preparing cross-module information). The magic for optimization will be in flambda-flambda passes, and not in the flambda to clambda layers.</p>
<p>Shows several examples of inlining, simplication and dead code elimination and why its significantly easier in the flambda form for simple microexamples. Also shows lambda lifting!</p>
<p>Change the performance model. Now its WYSIWYG, but we want some sort of understandable compile-time evaluation. For example, consider a map function as a metaprogramming function that you want to execute at compile time without all the intermediate closure allocation.</p>
<p>Add build_test to your OPAM to make it easier to test the compiler, and Obj-using code is very likely to break if you do certain mutations behind the compiler, or dead code elimination might happen if you use a value behind the compiler's back.</p>
<p>Q: SimonPJ: why is it easier to do closure conversion first, as it's a lot easier in GHC to do the opposite. There are now two ways to get a value in scope doing it the other way.<br />A: In Haskell you have everything in your closure, since you get the information from the closure.<br />Q: Think of lambda calculus with let<br />A: We do flow analysis to get around this!<br />Q: This is quite complex. Is it whole program analysis?<br />A: Restricted to a single compilation unit, and a few other cases, not cross-module yet.</p>
<p>Q: Yoann: if the prediction is "its always faster" then why do you care about predictability?</p>
<h2>Replacing the format string hack with GADTs</h2>
<p>Benoit Vaugon talks about how to improve the typing of Format strings in OCaml by using GADT encodings. He stats with showing basic examples of the Printf module, and advanced examples that include the "%a" callback, date scanning and hex dumping.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo17-e1380051856191.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1508" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo17-e1380051856191-300x225.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The OCaml type checker has an inferred type that encodes the details of the format string in a "format6" type that has lots of type parameters that describe the format string contents.<br />During type checking, the literal string is parsed and there is manual inference of the format6 type parameters. At runtime, the format strings are represented by the string from the source code.</p>
<p>During printing functions, it parses the format and count parameters and accumulates parameters. It then extracts and patches subformats, and finally calls the C printf function. Scanning is more complex but broadly similar.</p>
<p>There are quite a few problems with this. There are 5 (!) format string parsers (two in Printf, two in Scanf, one in the type checker) and there are lots of little incompatibilities as a result. For example</p>
<pre>Printf.printf "%1.1s" "hello"</pre>
<p>Results in Invalid_argument exception despite the static type checking, with a useless error message.</p>
<p>There is a weakness in the type checker too, for example</p>
<pre>Printf.sprintf "%s.+f" 3.14</pre>
<p>results in the format string being printed.</p>
<p>You can also segfault from there, such as</p>
<pre>Format.printf "@%d%s" 42 "hello"</pre>
<p>will segfault.</p>
<p>Speed is also a concern, as parsing the format at runtime is slow, and reparsing is required by another slow C printing function. Lots of memory allocation is required.</p>
<p>The new implementation sorts all this out by using GADTs to represent the formats. The format6 type is now concrete and not magic predefined. Formats now also become statically allowed and not multiply passed around dynamically.</p>
<p>The new implementation (which he shows) is a fairly epic GADT but quite regular when broken down into pattern clauses and examined with respect to the old implementation.</p>
<p>Issues: evaluation order changes slightly, as for printing functions the parameters are accumulated before printing. String_of_format is implemented by "%identity" and in the new implementation, we need to change the representation (either regenerate the string from the GADT or implement formats by a tuple).<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo18-e1380051839961.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright  wp-image-1509" height="210" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo18-e1380051839961-225x300.jpg" width="158" /></a></p>
<p>There's now only one format parser (down from 4-5) for the standard library and OCaml type checker</p>
<pre>type ('b,'c,'e,'f) fmt_ebb = Fmt_EBB:
 ('a,'b,'c,'d,'e,'f) CamlinternalFormatBasics.fmt -&gt;
 ('b,'c,'e,'f) fmt_ebb
val fmt_ebb_of_string : string -&gt; ('b,'c,'e,'f) fmt_ebb
val type_format: ('x,'b,'c,'t,'u,'v) format6 -&gt;
   ('a,'b,'c,'d,'e,'f) fmtty -&gt; ('a,'b,'c,'d,'e,'f) format6</pre>
<p>(this looks verbose but isnt really exposed outside of the compiler.</p>
<p>Another issue is the "%(..%r..%)" construction, since we need to include a proof term of the number of "%r" occurrences. The encoding for this is quite complex.</p>
<p>Performance of the new system is significantly better across the board. A hello world goes from (230ns to 55ns) timing and (732 to 24 bytes allocated) for example.</p>
<p>Q: Oleg did it already in Haskell <i>(ha ha -- editor)</i>. He notes that six parameters arent needed, as the GADT is the interpreter over the paramters.<br />A: yes can remove them if we split the Printf and Scanf format, and there is also a format4 which removes several parameters. We also have a problem with error messages since all the type parameters make things really complicated.<br />Q: Oleg: the work of interpreting the stream is pushed into the GADT, but if you write an interpreter over the GADT then we have simpler external types.<br />...discussion moves into offline discussion.</p>
<h2>Dynamic types in OCaml</h2>
<p>Gregoire Henry wants to do dynamic types in OCaml.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo19-e1380052996312.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1515" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo19-e1380052996312-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>
<ul><li>Structural type introspection: generic I/O primitives, type-safe (unlike Marshal) and typed (not written in Camlp4) -- these are polytypic functions.</li>
<li>Normal type introspection, for dynamic values (a k/v store or a DSL with dynamic typing), or extensible polytypic functions for abstract types.</li>
<li>This would also give us a common type representation for (e.g.) Eliom services that will be converted to Javascript, or for FFI libraries, and to let the debugger explore the heap with exact typing information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably isnt a single representation that fits all these use cases: We need to preserve abstraction when desired, but also to break abstraction when desired (e.g. by the debugger or a generic printer, but not by accident!), and it shouldn't impose a big performance hit.</p>
<p>Gregoire gives a description of a polytypic printing function</p>
<pre>let rec print (type t) (ty: t ty) (v:t) =
  match head ty with
  |Int -&gt; print_int v
  | String -&gt; print_string v
  | List ty -&gt; print_list (print ty) v
  | Sum desc -&gt;
  let (name, args) = sum_get desc v in
  print_string name 
  ...</pre>
<p>We define a predefined type "t ty" and a syntax for type expressions "(type val t) of type "t ty". We then introduce implicit type arguments which are optional arguments instantiated at call-site with the dynamic representation of the expected type.</p>
<pre>val print : ?t:(typ val 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; string
let print ?(type val t) (v:t) = ...

type t = R of int * int | ...
let x = R (1,2)
let () = print x (* implicit arg is (type val t) *)</pre>
<p>This is experimental syntax, but is shows how we can keep the representation abstract but the printer can still operate over it since the implicit argument passes the printer around.</p>
<p>The main problem is now how we mix polytypic function and abstraction, without always printing "abstract" instead of the real underlying structure. One solution is an extensible polytypic function.</p>
<pre>module M: sig
 type t
 val x: t
end = struct
  type t = R of int * int
  let x = R(22,7) let () = register_printer (external type val t) (fun x -&gt; ... )

end
let () = print x</pre>
<p>We register a printer internally in the module, without exposing its internal type externally, but still let it be printed. The internal and external types are different though. We do need to figure out a canonical name for types defined outside the current compilation unit (its absolute path).</p>
<p>By default though, abstraction should consistently introduce new nominal types, but we're not sure how to reference all the of the external names of a given type within its initial compilation unit (open problem). A pragmatic approach to solving this is the manual or semi-automatic creation of runtime "type names".</p>
<p>In conclusion, they have a GADT for structural introspection and a RTT representation with global names. &#160;There is also a type-constructor index association table. &#160;Implicit type arguments (lightweight syntax for calling polytypic function, and explicit type parameters for polymorphic functions).</p>
<p>Q: what's the gain of putting this into the compiler?</p>
<p>A: you may miss language corners, such as firstclass modules or functors, as your "userspace" OCaml code has to pass a type witness into a functor or firstclass module. &#160;Compiler support makes this passing much easier. &#160;The other big benefit is clear error messages from this compiler integration in the long term. &#160;It's not currently easy for beginners, and this is very important to get right if this becomes a supported feature.</p>
<h2>On variation, injectivity and abstraction</h2>
<p>Jacques Garrigue speaks about an interesting bug in the type checker that needs some language changes. There was PR#5985 which was a serious type checker bug that lost injectivity.</p>
<pre>module F(S: sig type 'a s end) = struct
  include S
  type _ t = T : 'a -&gt; 'a s t
end
module M = F (struct type 'a s = int end)
let M.T x = M.T 3 in x
- : 'a = &lt;poly&gt; <i>the type is lost!</i></pre>
<p>After expanding "s", the definition of "M.t" is actually "type _t = T : 'a -&gt; int t" but "'a" is not marked as an existential.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo20-e1380054255495.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1521" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo20-e1380054255495-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In order to protect against this unsoundness, all variables in type declarations must be bound, either by appearing inside the type parameters or be existentially bound (i.e. only present in GADTs). Inside type parameters, these variables must be <b>injective</b>.</p>
<p>OCaml doesnt do injectivity directly, since it relies of variance inference (since we have subtyping). The variance of a parameter is either <i>explicit</i> for abstract and private types or constrained parameters, or its <i>inferred</i> from its occurrences otherwise.</p>
<p>Constrained type parameters have been present since the very start.</p>
<pre>type 'a t = T of 'b constraint 'a = 'b list</pre>
<p>Rules for checking variance in this case become much more complicated, since constrained parameters variance must now be <b>explicit</b> The variance of type variables inside constrained parameters must also be weaker or equal the version inside the body of the definition.</p>
<pre>type +'a t = T of 'b constraint 'a = 'b list (* 'b covariant *)
type 'a r = 'a -&gt; int                        (* contravariant *)
type +'a t = T of 'b constraint 'a = 'b r    (* Fails *)
(* 'b is contravariant in parameters but covariant inside *)</pre>
<p>In OCaml though, the variance of a parameter is allowed to be weakened through abstraction.</p>
<pre>module M : sig
  type +'a u 
end = struct 
  type 'a u = int
end</pre>
<p>This is correct for the types, but becomes incorrect when used for <i>type parameters</i>.</p>
<pre>module F(X: sig type 'a r end) = struct
  type +'a t = T ob 'b constraint 'a = 'b X.r
end
module N = F (struct type 'a r = 'a -&gt; int end)</pre>
<p>Even when we assume that r is invariant, 'b is inferred as invariant from the parameter of t, which overrides the covariance of the body. Meanwhile in the module N, the variance is now wrong.</p>
<p>How do we fix this? We need to refine the definition of variance, as traditional variance subumption defines a lower bound on the variance, but we need to add some upper bound information too, to be sure that parameters cannot have a strong variance.</p>
<p><i>(technical explanation of how to compose variances omitted here)</i></p>
<p>In OCaml 4.01, full variance inference is done using 7 flags (the last is a special case required for principality). Some uses will no longer type check so programs may be rejected for safety.</p>
<p>In the future, Jeremy Yallop, Leo White and Jacques would like to add injectivity annotations for abstract types.</p>
<pre>type #'a s
type _ t = T : 'a -&gt; 'a s t</pre>
<p>Add new types for isomorphic abbreviations, as Haskell does</p>
<pre>module M : sig type #'a t val f : int -&gt; ['pos] t end = struct
  type 'a t = new int
  let f x = (abs x : int :&gt; 'a t)
end</pre>
<p>This is similar to private, but subtyping will work in both directions -- this is useful for efficiency, encoding runtime types and allows coercions to be delayed until the signature rather than in the both (in the example above, the coercion in "f" could be omitted) due to the signature.</p>
<p>Another problem is that one cannot prove the uniqueness of abstract types, and we dont know whether an abstract type is contractive (so even if you use rectypes, the following functor can never be defined)</p>
<pre>module Fixpoint (M: sig type 'a t end) = struct
  type fix = fix M.t 
end
Error: the type abbreviation fix is cyclic</pre>
<p>One also never knows whether an abstract type may be a float, so the float array optimization may be mismatched.</p>
<h2>OCamlot: lots of OCaml testing!</h2>
<p>(will post David's slides on the OCaml Labs website since it's one of our talks. Will edit this post when that happens).</p>
<h2>Merlin: editor support for OCaml</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo21-e1380057773342.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1530" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo21-e1380057773342-225x300.jpg" /></a><br /><a href="https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin">Merlin</a> is a sophisticated editor assistant for OCaml that provides autocompletion in vim and emacs. They leap straight into an interactive demo that's awesome: autocompletion, module introspection when writing a functor, and so on.</p>
<p>Unlike other tools, this doesn't rely on a CMT file, so code doesn't need to compile (except for source browsing). Your project can have type errors when using Merlin!</p>
<p>It integrates with the ecosystem and has direct support for Findlib. There is no direct support for camlp4 however, with specific support for some extensions. If you want a new shiny extension then talk directly to them</p>
<p>There is build system support for running either omake or Jenga in polling mode (for iterative recompilation). Omake rules can inform Merlin to get a consistent state of the project!</p>
<p>A typical session: Parsing is done in two stages and the OCaml parser has been modified to be much more resilient to errors. The usual typing rules are applied, but passed onto a more "relaxed" typers in case of errors to give some support for incremental parsing.</p>
<p>Coming soon is documentation (ha!) as well as retrieval for ocamldoc comments to further augment hints, as well as even more error recovery heuristics. Some of the patches will also be submitted upstream to improve error handling (by accumulating them instead of printing them directly).</p>
<p>It's available on OPAM under an MIT license via "opam install merlin" and thanks to Jane Street for letting them work on it during an internship there, and all the bug reporters!</p>
<p>Q: Have you considered running Merlin on a remote system and speak the same JSON protocol?<br />A: They haven't, but it really shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Q: Julien V: do we have to build first?<br />A: No you dont have to build first<br />Q: What happens when you change branches in a project<br />A: For project-wide information you need to compile and rebuild.</p>
<p>Q: in the second pass of type checking, what does "relaxed" mean<br />A: When typing fails for some branch of the AST, in the simple case we introduce a fresh type variable and attempt to do unification with the result of this. This will never be sound, but lets it make progress and give SOME feedback to the user.</p>
<p>Q: is this a new type checker?<br />A: No its the original type checker with augmented error handling paths to do more unification.</p>
<p>Q: is the relaxed checking really worthwhile? It wasnt a lot of use in gcc since you get a lot of followon errors that are meaningless.<br />A: lots of discussion, opinions split, it can be disabled!</p>
<h2>Understanding memory behaviour of programs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo22-e1380058304144.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1533" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo22-e1380058304144-150x150.jpg" /></a><br />Cagdas B doing a PhD on memory profiling. He wants to study the behaviour of OCaml programs and work on decreasing memory footprint and generally reduce GC pressure on real OCaml programs.</p>
<p>Shows Why3 graph (see photograph) and they're running nice finegrained analysis over it on real world analyses. How do they generate these graphs?</p>
<pre>$ opam switch 4.00.1+ocp-memprof
$ opam install why3
$ OCAMLRUNPARAM=m why3replayer.opt -C why3.conf p9_16</pre>
<p>Patched compiler and then the OCAMLRUNPARAM will generate a lot of sampled snapshots of the OCaml heap. There's no need to change the code or the compilation options. Then install analysis tools</p>
<pre>$ opam install ocp-memprof
$ ocp-memprof -loc -sizes PID</pre>
<p>The final step analyses all the snapshots. But what is a snapshot? It's a compressed version of the OCaml heap, with location ids, a graph with pointers, and has saved globals (toplevel modules). We obtain the snapshots by computing a linear scan of all the heap values.</p>
<p>The OCAMLRUNPARAM=m forces the program to generate a snapshot after every major GC, or request the program to generate a snapshot via a HUP signal, or via a new "dump_heap" function that's been added to the GC module.</p>
<p>It works by reserving some space inside the standard OCaml value block, and so there is minimal runtime performance impact except when dumping out snapshots after a GC. There's no space overhead since the header size isnt changed. However, it's only available on 64-bit platforms and reduces block size to 64GB. Ran experiment with OPAM and location identifiers are limited.</p>
<p>There's one tool based on the snapshot identifiers and the "memprof" tool gets all identifiers from the heap and the corresponding location, and then looks up the right types from a specific location using cmt files (the typed AST).</p>
<p>Plan for this work is to improve the current framework (aggregate information by type and location) and to recover more types, and build more tools around it!</p>
<p>Q: Roshan: one common usecase is when grabbing locations, its boring to see Array.create and it would be nice to see a backtrace of the execution to see <i>where</i> the allocation happened.<br />A: this is a problem indeed (discussion about the ongoing Mark Shinwell patches too, and previous talk about backtrace analysis from last years workshop).</p>
<h2>Benchmarking in Core</h2>
<p>Roshan James about microbenchmarking in JS Core. Precise measurementis essential for performance critical code. We want to measure the execution cost of functions that are relatively cheap. Functions with a short execution time that run millions of times in a tight loop.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo23-e1380059673542.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1538" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo23-e1380059673542-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The essence of benchmarking is to run a time loop (like Time.now) a lot of times. We need to figure out how to compute a batch size to account for the time it takes to run the actual timing measurement. Similar to Criterion for Haskell, where they loop Time.now to figure out how long it takes to compute the time itself, and then run the benchmark function, and compute a full estimate. This works ok, but it requires density plots to let you visualise the form of the error (bimodal, or something else, for example).</p>
<p>There is a lot of noise in microbenchmarking, such as delayed costs due to GC, and variance in execution times is affected by batch sizes. So if we vary the batch size, the variance changes quite a bit since the GC is running in different intervals during the batches. The GC noise has a periodicity though!</p>
<p>They treat microbenchmarking as a linear regression, and then fit execution time to a batch size. They vary the batch size geometrically to get a better linear fit (shows a very linear graph). Theres now no need to estimate the clock and other constant errors, since they are accounted for by the y-intercept which shows the constant costs.</p>
<p>Other costs can also be predicted in the same way, such as estimate memory allocations and promotions using batch size too. This also allows measuring a goodness of fit by using R2 and bootstrapping techniques.</p>
<p>Example use of Core_bech is really easy:just</p>
<pre>open Core.Std
open Core_bench.Std
let t1 = Bench.Test.create ~name:"id" (fun () -&gt; ())</pre>
<p>Is the identity run for example, and just put something more complex in there. Output is an Ascii_table with lots of columns showing interesting results.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo24-e1380059880672.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1539" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo24-e1380059880672-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Some functions have a strange execution time, and the observation isnt a great fit. Between runs, they also directly query the GC and directly query how many times some things have happened (minor collections and so on), and include these along with the batch size in the predictor. With multiple predictors, they are really close to the observed results indeed.</p>
<p>(lots of interesting maths about how they perform runtime cost decomposition)</p>
<p>Its available via "opam install core_bench" and they want to expose more predictors by measuring the effect of live words on performance, and counters for major collection work per minor gc. Accuracy of results is interesting as least-squares is susceptible to outliers so they can incorporate the knowledge that the measurement is heavy-tailed.</p>

<p>Rush in the 70s with Symbolics and the amazingly cool hardware, followed by the rush to logic programming that led to his grants disappearing. Midway through the 80s, they discovered we wouldnt get parallelism for free with all this magic. After that came the era of machine learning and knowledge ontology crusades, but they are very specialised bits of tech. There remain sectors where ontologies are useful. Nowadays its the multicore crusades, and FP is emerging as useful.</p>
<p>Every road leads to some form of FP, because the principles underlying it apply. Dave does vector programming, Haskell does this with array transformation.</p>
<p>Dave was talking to Simon PJ outside and claimed that "FP has won!", at which point Simon replied "really?" (laughter). OO techniques can also lead to a lot of tangled code: witness the evolution of Smalltalk to the current generation of languages.</p>
<p>FP technical challenges: what happens when you have a lot of functions, and a group of consenting adults are doing it together. This is called software engineering, or at worst, IT!</p>
<p>Lots of good work in the community on approaching large scale programming. Scala is a bit too complex for Dave (and audience rumbles in agreement or disagreement?). Java and JNI should just die. Erlang and actors are successful to decouple software. But do we really need to hide all our queues, and do we really need to hide our queues? Static analysis of queues are desired.</p>
<p>Want to go fast? Computers like rectangles, all the way down! Array operations and vector processing is the way to go in the long-term.</p>
<p>To go to industry, we need end-to-end toolchains. If you use MS Project, then you probably shouldn't introduce any new tools.</p>
<p>The first commercial customer for Smalltalk in the 1980s was Techtronix, who wanted to embed reusable tech in their oscilloscopes. If you're building a serious product like this, it needed language interop between C++ (the logic sensor) and the Smalltalk. Respect the language cultures among components (anyone remember s-records?). ROM had to be replaced with Flash because noone can write code that doesn't need upgrading (groans from the audience).</p>
<p>With the right tools, programmers will be able to go as quickly as Smalltalk, or at worse Java. We need the work of Simon [PJ] and colleagues on Haskell. Scala is so complex will become the Java (which is the Cobol of tomorrow).</p>
<p>When shipping products, you need to track all the versions of language components in the toolchain. Too many FP toolchains are monolithic and make it hard to track components in the field. JVMs are so slow because they don't have a good sharing model (DLLs).</p>
<p>What Dave would like is version-to-version transformation in languages. Y2K was a problem not because IBM hadn't fixed it in their OS, but because customers had modified their local installations and were pinned 6-10 versions behind! The same will happen for existing FPs that fragment into multiple implementations, so will they descend into multiple version hell or will standards emerge from the community?</p>
<p>Also, lets not leave the data behind. Can we alias data from existing legacy sources into our new languages, and not aim for the perfect representations? Most of our programs are dealing with problems with existing data, not code.</p>
<p>Onto deployment issues. Erlang works very well for the problem domain that it's designed for, but more complex domains exist like OSGI. Hot codeswap and live updates are often viewed as "boring problems" but are vital to real world deployments. Space usage must be paid attention to: how long can a given JVM stay up without leaking? Serialization is important to persist data across versions. If we're going to use "esoteric control structures" like CallCC, tailcalls or tags, the JVM isn't going to get us there.</p>
<p>These days, if you can't stay in your local cache, you will lose several orders of magnitude performance... you'll need directly connected CPU (or SSD!) memory, and static initalization, and language interop (eagerly vs laziness). Functional data structures and immutable collections are still immature, but need more work to convince doubting Thomas' about their scalability in real applications.</p>
<p>Hardware support for these are important. Intel Haswell has hardware transaction support (hence can be used by Azul JVMs etc) but we need more for functional langauge performance. There have been $2bn put into speeding up the JVM to make it as fast as C++. Google has a technology called Pinnacle which uses software write barriers that use VMs that execute directly, with a register model and not a stack model (which is easy to put together but hard to make fast). The new generation of language VMs will support direct execution and support modern functional programming languages.</p>
<p>"We all love types" -- Dave on objects, but not variables ("its easy to be cooperative with that definition!"). Pluggable types by Gilad are really cute, because they move us towards a world where particular features (Dave likes behavioural types) can be woven in. Perhaps can be done in a dependently typed world. Another good candidate are approximate types and dimensional types. When all these are put together though, it all needs to fit together with sound compositional semantics.</p>
<p>When using an interesting PL, Dave wants warnings to be emitted when the compiler makes space/time tradeoffs so that the programmer can decide between elegance and performance (also mentioned that Haskell programmers do this for .</p>
<p>How does language evolution work? Arthur Whitney maintains K, and he ensures that every version of K is incompatible with the previous one. This is a blessing (!) since it avoids a kitchen sink language and ensures a high quality set of libraries. Quite often there's a tussle between languages and libraries because there's not enough coevolution. For example, are closures in Java really useful for the tradeoff in the complexity of the VM? Perhaps we should be looking towards a collection of small correct languages instead of a few partly right and largely wrong languages such as Ada or Java (the Java hate is strong here -- editor).</p>
<p>Those of us that have programmed in vector languages (going back to APL) are largely write once read once languages because the code is so hard to read. One trick Dave does with K is to annotate comments inside expressions and use cold-folding without a point-free style to understand vector codeflow better. Also seeing the environment and current name bindings is extremely useful for teaching new languages.</p>
<p>The real problem is: comprehensions, folds, monads -- WTF? Yet to see anyone from the monad community give a talk to understand monads. It's typically "you dont need monads" and then the word is used multiple times in the talk. If it's not important, why mention it so often? Quite often, the FP experience makes normal programmers feel stupid because they don't break through this terminology barrier. We as a community need to help people break through the barrier of not being formally trained in mathematics for whatever reason ("category theory for breakfast?") and *be productive* in FPs.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was like this in the early days. People see a blank window and aren't sure what to do next. Objects irritated people when they came out, but FP scares people. This is a danger as we go through and wow people with what we can do, but make it look like magic. People change their habits are different rates and we need to understand that. With Haskell, it was odd that he had to get the program "right" (or right/wrong) before it work, as opposed to not working.</p>
<p>Bill Buxton (UI researcher friend) pointed out that people can't much get beyond programming a VCR. 4GLs were pretty much their limit. Dave's done a lot of work on evangelizing Smalltalk, but feels it was still too hard. People just didn't understand how to separate behavior, as the best practices on how to build objects were foreign to most of them. This all settled on some mix of SQL and some glue code, which doesn't require learning a lot of new technologies.</p>
<p>Given there are many different types of programmers, do they all really need the full power of FP? Some subset of features is more useful, with one way to do things that doesn't change from release to release. For example, a simple dictionary keeps changing from Hashmap to concurrent Hashmap to something else, but ultimately is still a dictionary. How do we separate the reasoning over performance and structure and not scare people with both at the same time. Knuth started doing this decades ago with literate code, and we *still* dont have a decent way of writing documentation and code in the same place.</p>
<p>We are still missing a pure FP book that is built in the same style and comprehension as <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>. We need thinks that you look the code and represent things more densely (for example, why don't we use Unicode in the same style as APL symbols to increase the succinctness?). They are working on J programs that move glyphs around on the iPad as an example of this 4GL density.</p>
<p>We need to take all these ideas and *talk more* about metaphors in FP. Where's the "Scala, F#, Clojure, the good parts" and a frank exposition about the antipatterns? Don't lie about where the dragons are, but colour code them appropriately to not surprise programmers.</p>
<p>We need to understand how to design with types. In the vector languages, this is called "shape shifting" as they don't have types, but similar concept. It's also hard to get the community people to talk about shape shifting, and as a result the art is being lost in the new generation of languages. For FP, can the Yodas in the audience help their audience to "trust the types" ?</p>
<p>Q: In the top 20 languages, every language has a free-or-open-source runtime. This will make a huge difference as it lets people experiment.</p>
<p>A: It's not been a barrier in experimentation for Dave, but it has been a barrier for commercial use. Dave would not attribute a particular significance to open source as it's never been a real problem for him (using trial versions and so forth). Open source is a mixed sword, as it tends to product impoverished language teams that don't have enough resources to move forward. The really good virtual machine implementors are commercially polished (c.f. the $2bn behind the JVM performance from earlier). Clojure is a great example where they appealed to the community to pay on their own behalf to donate for a production version. To build a serious production PL, you need a lot of government research money or a major commercial sponsor.</p>
<p>Q: Marius asks about mobile and embedded and why FP hasn't cracked it.</p>
<p>A: they are often late to the game, and it's often not easy to target the runtimes with a high performance runtime. You have to be willing to understand the interface.</p>
<p>Q: Phil Walder says the scariest thing is that if you become a success, then Smalltalk takes the form of C++</p>
<p>A: (or Java!). Being able to maintain the independence of the language creators vs a major player is crucial to conceptual integrity. (Phil) Tools that will migrate between version X and Y and a sustainable ecosystem. It's important to ensure that the creators get paid to maintain -- even the JVM only has 10-20 people in the core team and a vast ecosystem.</p>
<h3>OCaml at Facebook via the Hack language</h3>
<p>Julien Verlauget is talking about how Facebook is adopting OCaml.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/1148380_10151682552766094_1789859397_n.jpg"><img alt="1148380_10151682552766094_1789859397_n" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1458" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/1148380_10151682552766094_1789859397_n-300x225.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Why PHP is good: fast installation times, lots of libraries, easy to learn, and scales in a parallel way (multiple instances).</p>
<p>However, Facebook doesn't care about any of these features. What Facebook wants is a fast feedback loop between writing code and having it appear on screen. There's no good way to write a unit test for an experience, and instead a fast feedback loop between code and a live site is how people still work at Facebook today.</p>
<p>Performance at the scale of Facebook really matters. 1% can be a huge bump, but PHP is really hard to optimize due to all the dynamic features in the language. Aside from runtime performance, the other concern is development time for engineers, who need to avoid security problems and general bugs in an incredibly large codebase.</p>
<p>The first attempt at this was to scale the runtime via HipHop. The first attempt was to compile PHP into an interpreter (via sandboxes) and then compile production code to C++. Unfortunately this lead to a huge divergence in performance characteristics between the interpreter and compiled code which led to confusion in production.</p>
<p>The current one is HHVM which is a combined model via JIT runtime that patches code at runtime and helps merge these models.</p>
<p>HHVM is still a PHP platform, and a new model called Hack provides a *new programming language* that targets HHVM (which is essentially a PHP runtime).</p>
<p>Hack is a <b>statically typed language for HHVM</b>. It's compatible with PHP and interoperates with no overhead and has the same runtime representation as PHP. It has evolved from PHP, and so if you know PHP, you know Hack. It's designed for <i>incremental adoption</i> via introducing gradual typing (c.f. keynote talk about not scaring programmers not used to types).</p>
<pre>function foo(): void {
  $x = 'hello';
  return $x;
}</pre>
<p>This returns a readable error message in the style of a statically typed language, since the inference algorithm keeps a witness about every value's type and shows counter examples.</p>
<p>The Hack type system must be annotated with class members, function parameters and return types. Everything else is inferred to minimize programmer burden.</p>
<p>Hack types include:</p>
<ul><li>Nullable such as
<pre>?int</pre>
<p>mainly because of the huge code base that had no pattern matching, so null propagation is important</p></li>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Closures</li>
<li>Collections such as
<pre>Vector&lt;int&gt;</pre>
<p>that have generics too</p></li>
<li>Constraints</li>
<li>Type Aliasing</li>
<li>Extensible Records</li>
</ul>
<p>Demo of a simple mailbox demo follows. HH has a command line mode that lets you syntax highlight which parts of the source code are dynamically checked, by outputing the code with red if it's potentially unsafe. Awesome!</p>
<pre>class Mailbox {
  private $data;
  public function send($data) {
    $this-&gt;data = $data
  }
  public function fetch() {
    return $this-&gt;data;
  }
}</pre>
<p>(very PHP like but now he annotates it with specific types)</p>
<pre>class Mailbox {
  private string $data;
  public function send($data) : void {
    $this-&gt;data = $data
  }
  public function fetch() : string {
    return $this-&gt;data;
  }
}</pre>
<p>As a programmer, I now want to know if this has all been statically checked (since the previous checking mode showed several red sections which were potentially unsafe). He runs the compiler with a strict mode that rejects the source if there is any unsafe bits.</p>
<p>He then demonstrates how to propagate null types through the code, and then introduces several subtle errors that are all caught.</p>
<p>An audience members asks what happens if you send both an int and a string to a mailbox, and Julien demonstrates a "mixed" type that covers both (is this some sort of row polymorphism? -- editor).</p>
<p>The response time of the type checker is close to instantaneous (for the developer loop). Even with a thousand files, the type checkers gets back in a second or less with an error message.</p>
<p>To get the tooling right, Hack uses js_of_ocaml to compile <i>the entire OCaml type checker</i> to Javascript and then run in a complete web-based IDE (demonstrates a full cloud9-like IDE they use internally at FB). To work at scale, they created a server that runs persistently in the background and type checks all the files and responds from a memory cache.</p>
<p>At scale, the the autocomplete requires very lowlatency in the webbased editor, and users also use version control (e.g. switching between branches). The server also has to use a reasonable amount of RAM and have a reasonable initalization time. Fundamentally it has to be stable as developers have to depend on their tools.</p>
<p>A vast amount of code is written in OCaml for the tools. Good choice because it is ideal for symbolic computation, excellent performance and can be compiled to Javascript. Good C interop is really good. The main challenge is the lack of multicore, although Facebook works around it with their multiprocess architecture.</p>
<p>Architecture: the master process has multiple processes which uses shared memory to avoid having to go through the master. The underlying buffers are lock free (similar to our Xen shared memory ring! -- editor).</p>
<p>Advice on OCaml at scale:</p>
<ul><li>IPC -- use lockfree structures and think about sockets/pipes instead of just TCP</li>
<li>GC small heap and shared memory is compacted by master</li>
<li>OCaml makes you think hard about shared objects, which is a good thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: is it open source??<br />A: soon, this is the first time Facebook has talked about it publically.</p>
<h2>OpenX and Erlang ads</h2>
<p>What is OpenX: (i) An opensource PHP ad server (ii) OpenX is a global company with an ad service featuring a big ad exchange written in Erlang. This talk is about the transition from PHP to Erlang.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-1.jpg"><img alt="photo 1" class="size-medium wp-image-1401 alignright" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-1-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>1998-2007. it was a conventional PHP management system and MySQL. The company started using it as an EC2-based SaaS ad server and serving up clients successfully.</p>
<p>In 2008, they wanted to mix in an ad exchange, to add liquidity to marketplaces that have empty ads. At the same time, they moved offices to Pasadena and looked at new tech. Switched to Hadoop (Java) and Postgres (for some reason). Poor technical choices were made, such as writing to the database for every request (sometimes multiple times!).</p>
<p>In 2009 as the customers increased, there was a big push to scaling things up for performance (this is when the speaker joined the company). Switched Postgres to Cassandra to move from a relational database to a more NoSQL approach that had the appropriate consistency properties. At this time, the architecture was also decomposed to give them headroom to scale for a while, particularly by adding HTTP load balancers and so on.</p>
<p>They wanted to add even more low latency stuff, such as spot bids for immediate bids on empty slots. Anthony decides that the model was a good fit for Erlang, since one request needed to fan out to multiple backend services with a soft-realtime limit to return a response to the user. It took a few months to prototype an Erlang based solution which worked very well.</p>
<p>After this first experience with Erlang and evangelising it, and pointing it out to his coworkers, they came up with another good problem: analyzing the frequency of how often someone looks at an ad. This required a new database that would hold bespoke data efficiently, and also integrated Riak from Basho to interface with the database to run the query engine. This now holds on the order of billions of keys.</p>
<p>In 2007, they ran into problems with Cassandra due to making an incompatible upgrade which would have required OpenX to shut down their business to upgrade, which was unacceptable. Since they had a good experience with Riak core, they developed a new system to move away from Cassandra and add more Erlang for management stack.</p>
<p>In 2011, they decided to split their UI layer into a more Web 2.0-like UI API. The API continues to be implemented in PHP (with a Javascript UI clientside), but the Erlang evolution continued with a gateway service and marketplace service that are both pure Erlang. The basic problem is ad selection, and the logic for this is written as a DSL implemented in both Erlang and Java to enable code reuse across the tools.</p>
<p>However, Cassandra was still sticking around, and they wanted to move away from it. They implemented a data service layer to abstract away from the database. From the early days, they made a bad (but fast) choice to have clients directly call Cassandra via Thrift, as it was easy. They moved away to a more abstract model to get away from Thrift, and so could change clients. The new system could call both Cassandra and Riak to help evolve with both services running simultaneously and provide a <i>seamless migration path</i> to the new service (in stark contrast to the Cassandra upgrade story from earlier).</p>
<p>They also decided that the PHP use for the API was a bad idea, and so switched to Python. They engaged Erlang Solutions to write them an API router since their core team was busy (an example of external consultants coming in and being useful -- editor). The current system involved RabbitMQ coordination, and Riak's replication logic to move out to the colos for publication.</p>
<p>Currently they have 14-15 services in Erlang 7-8 in Java, and a blend of Python/PHP.</p>
<p>How did a PHP shop end up with so much Erlang? Well, they laid off all the PHP developers when they moved offices (lots of audience laughter).</p>
<p>More seriously, the architectural choices are important:</p>
<ul><li>Cloud based (generic hardware, automated bootstrap, deployment, package oriented development and fault tolerance).</li>
<li>Service based (loosely coupled, single purpose components, pools of components, polyglot so multiple languages/</li>
<li>Cross language tools: Thrift (RPC between components), protobuf (RTB and Riak) and <a href="http://www.lwes.org">Lwes</a> (logging and monitoring) which was open sourced by Yahoo after being originally written at Goto.com. A system called Framework that provides templates for code layout, builds RPMs/debs and integrates with autotools. It enforces versioning and reproducibility across languages.</li>
<li>Finally, evangelism is really important. If possible fix the game via architectural choices to set the scene for change. Find a project to showcase the technology, and be responsible for the project's success. Make sure to share work, and remember that tools are <i>really important</i> to make it easy for others to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really important is figuring out build toolchain -- it can be so arcane. They did spend time on integrating with Erlang (erlrc inegrates with packaging system, erlstart to manage lifecycle, erlnode for ?).</p>
<p>Hiring: train people rather than trying to hire knowledgeable. Operations have unfamiliar systems to manage, and developers have new concepts and patterns.</p>
<p>How did Erlang help OpenX developers? The language fit the service model very well. The let-it-crash philosphy and supervision trees led to fewer real service outages.</p>
<p>OpenX is doing really well as a business, too: 250+ billion monthly transactions, 12+ billion daily bids, thousands of machines in 5 colos, 300 employees and $150m+ revenue in 2012.</p>
<p>Q: Marius: with a service based solution, how do you library them up?<br />A: Their services aren't hugely fine grained and so usually a module or two (not a lot of state)</p>
<p>Q: Anil: is framework usable from languages? RPM integration seems killer<br />A: It's still esoteric and internals not docced, but would welcome a chat!</p>
<h3>BAE systems on Redesigning the Computer for Security</h3>
<p>Tom Hawkins speaking on DARPA funded project.</p>
<p>SAFE is a codesign of:<br />a new application langauge (breezE)<br />a new systems programming language (Tempest)<br />A new OS<br />A new processor<br />and security at every level for defense in depth.</p>
<p>Emphasising hardware enforced security since dynamic checking is too much overhead in software, for example for fine-grained information flow control. Hardware IFC handles the most general attack model (scripting down to machine code injection).</p>
<p>Hardware overview: every word of data contains a tuple of (group 5 bits, tag 59 bits and payload 64 bit). The Atomic Group Unit checks atom typs (e.g. instructions, data pointers and streams). The Fat Pointer Unit (confusingly, FPU) checks pointer operations, and tag management unit (TMU).</p>
<p>The label model can be used for efficient hardware typing, and more recently they are using labels for Control Flow Integrity (e.g. to prevent return oriented attacks). Register file is 32 elements deep, memory is accessed through load/store, and every bit of data in the system is a well-formed atom (and so has tag/groups associated with it).</p>
<p>FPU deals with buffer range checks (e.g. underflow or overflows for a buffer).</p>
<p>The TMU is where the magic is. It combines all the operations from the various operations being worked on (instructions, memory) and the TMU acts as a "database" checking that the operation is consistent with local policy, and the machine can continue execution or raise a security exception.</p>
<p>At day 1, they had an outline for an ISA but nothing else. TIARA project was a baseline (Howie Shrobe, Andrw DeHon, Tom Knight) and they had no languages, no hardware and no toolchain.</p>
<p>They started by sketching out an assembly language and then building an ISA simulator. They simulated simple assembly programs, and HW researchers started coding in Bluespec (a Haskell-like FP that Lennart keynoted about at CUFP 2011 in Japan).</p>
<p>The PL researchers started designing Breeze. Plan was to "steal" Andrew Meyers work on JIF, and "Breeze should be done in a couple of months"!. It didn't quite work out that short (laughter).</p>
<p>SAFE assembly is as low level as expected, but it adds some new properties:</p>
<ul><li>frames manage fat pointer bounds</li>
<li>Atomic group declarations on data mark critical sections</li>
<li>Tags on data can be marked (e.g. bootloader private)</li>
<li>Secure closures is code/data with the authority to run code over the data (they call it gates)</li>
</ul>
<p>Assembly is tedious and so they started with macros. The Breeze interpreter is now running and there was pressure to start building the compiler. The OS guys wanted a language to build the higher level components.</p>
<p>Solution: a SAFE assembly DSL embedded in Haskell that uses Haskell as the macro language and becomes the library for the future Breeze compiler.</p>
<p>Breeze Language: version 7 -- just the datatypes for Booleans was hard and took 4-5 weeks ("this IFC stuff is kind of tricky"). The convenience and modularity of lexical authority passing and one-principal per module is extremely inconvenient!</p>
<p>SAFE Assembly in Haskell looks like a typical EDSL. A monad captures program descriptions, and macros set up data tags and also for better control flow (such as a while loop or ifelse conditionals in the asssembly).</p>
<p>At Year 1.5, the EDSL is still assembly language, no matter how many macros there are. Manual register allocation, calling conventions and data structures. Meanwhile the Breeze compiler was inching off the ground, but there is an awkward transition from high level CPS IR to assembly. There needs to be an intermediate form somewhere. However, the SAFE EDSL in Haskell works great in the compiler backend plugged in seamlessly with the Breeze code generator, which was nice.</p>
<p>Breeze Language is now on Version 12 and continues to answer questions. "What do we do on an access violation?". Simply stopping the machine isn't enough, since "What if I maliciously send you data that you can't access?". "Simple I'll just check the label before I attempt to read it?". "But what if the label itself is private?". This was the big "aha" moment in IFC, since private labels end up being a poison pill in IFC.</p>
<p>At Year 2.0, the Breeze compiler is going through a major overhaul since it needs improvements (the middle IR is improved but not enough). They temporarily shelve the compiler and they realize it wont come to the rescue of the OS. They really needed a higher low-level language than just assembly.</p>
<p>Breeze language v23 has a solution to poison pills: make all labels public! To label data you must specify the label in advance (brackets), but public labels are not compatible with lexical authority passing so they had to relax their original vision a little.</p>
<p>Year 2.5: Tempest is started as the systems PL for SAFE. Imperative with register allocation and optimizations and control of assembly with inlining and user specified calling conventions. It uses the SAFE EDSL to generate assembly (that was a successful DSL) and nicely fills the Breeze IR gap in the compiler for when that is resurrected.</p>
<p>Breeze language 34: delayed exceptions with not-a-value values (Nav).</p>
<p>The Tempest EDSL with inline assembly has a SAFE assembly sublanguage. The SAFE flow isnow the Breeze, Templest and Safe Assembly layers, with EDSLs of each gluing the compiler pipeline together. There is a SAFE ISA simulator and debugger, along with a Bluespec simulator to save on the FPGA debugging cycles. The TMU is an elaborate piece of hardware (an exotic CAM and cache structure) that a lot of the effort has gone into.</p>
<p>Lessons learnt:</p>
<ul><li>designing a higher order IFC language is <i>very hard</i> even with some of the most brilliant PL researchers in the world. Optimal number of researchers is 2-7 rather than any more :) Ben Pierce and Greg Morrisett arguing over very hard problems was a lot of fun in a hard problem space.</li>
<li>Day 1 should have started with Tempest, not assembly. Hard to be productive with assembly code, and tempest is the right level of runtime/processor codesign. Level of indirection provides insulation from a changing ISA.</li>
<li>EDSLs are great for bootstrapping a language and make excellent backend libraries. However, engineers must be comfortable with the host language and not all the engineers were comfortable with Haskell when they started. EDSLs are hard to debug (line number information apparently hard to get out of error messages vs a concrete syntax).</li>
<li>Concrete syntax is more relevnt for some languages than others (e.g. Tempest vs SAFE assembly). The best transition point to a concrete syntax is after developer pressure for modular programming. Once language has modularity, then the switch can be made without disruption.</li>
<li>Would a DSL have helped hardware design? Forever debugging ISS and FPGA instead of raw Bluespec. A DSL describing ISA semantics would have kept is synchronized by generating Bluespec, ISS and SAFE EDSL and Coq documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has been a huge project spanning a vast number of layers. It has produces a large number of interesting <a href="http://www.crash-safe.org/papers">papers</a> including one at ICFP this week on testing non-interference quickly by using QuickCheck to generate programs that don't violate non-interference properties.</p>
<h2>FRP at Netflix by Jafar Hussain</h2>
<p>Netflix used to have tight coupling between the middle tier and the UI teams. One-sized fits all messages and led to inefficient call patterns.</p>
<p>The plan was to decouple this by giving UI developers the ability to decouple components (or "force!").</p>
<p>Two developer personas at Netflix: Cloud and UI people. Netflix deals with a third of all US broadband traffic, so they need to think at scale but also to run on really tiny cheap devices that eke out all performance. How do they turn UI developers into effective cloud developers who think at scale?</p>
<p>Gave them UI comforts: Groovy, OO API and a Reactive API. Most UI developers (or indeed any developers) can't be trusted with locks. This means that reactive programming isn't enough, which leads to "how do we make parallel programs safe for developers"</p>
<p>Enter Erik Meijer, the legend himself! He asked "Whats the difference between a database query and a mouse drag event?". Database would use functional code and a mouse drag might be imperative. Erik points out that they are both collections.</p>
<p>New JS closure syntax in ES6 is fantastic to make them easier to use. If you imagine a query for well-rated movies, then you need to map over video lists. He then shows a mouse drag event, but points out that the structure of the code is very simpler. Instead of a "filter" operator, he uses "takeUntil" which stops the operation after some predicate has been satisfied.</p>
<p>The iterator pattern is similar to the observer, except for the bidirectional signalling. Iterators can throw next/hasNext/Throwable, but Observers dont have a similar completion semantic. What happens when we add these to the Observer? We end up with "onNext" and "onCompleted" and "onError", so now the Observer has comparable semantics to Iterator, so the only thing that changes is the direction of the errors.</p>
<p>Some platforms also have an Iterable. There is now also an Observable to which you can pass an Observer, in the same vein as passing an iterator to a Java Iterable. We also add a Disposable to both, so that when the IO stream has terminated, it can be stopped immediately without having to junk the rest of the data.</p>
<p>Erik and his team at MSR demonstrated that these patterns are dual, so that Iterable and Observable are dual! These are the Reactive Extensions libraries that is a combinator library for the Observable type. It's open source and has been ported to a number of other languages than C# (including Java).</p>
<p>Observable Monad is a Vector version of the Continuation monad. Null propagation semantics of the Maybe monad and Error propgation semantics of the Either monad. Produced and consumed with side-efects and acts as a fault line between pure and impure code. It can be composed functionally and cancellation semantics are clean. It can be synchronous or asynchronous which is a common mistake (to assume that Iterable is async -- either can also be sync simply by calling the functions immediately).</p>
<p>If you Map over Observable, then</p>
<pre>(rapid transcript)
var map = (observable, func) =&gt;
  { forEach: observer =&gt; 
    {
    var subscription =
     observable.forEach
       onNext : item =&gt; oserver.onNext(func(item))
       onError : error =&gt; observer.onError (error)
       onCompleted () =&gt; observer.onCompleted()</pre>
<p>We can use this to come up with a single reactive type for cloud and UI developers! Jafar demonstrates example of social notifications in the middle tier, but using Observable to filter notifications from a composition of the socialService and messageService. Both underlying services are returning observables, and are non-blocking and completely parallel. Both can execute synchronously or asynchronously and decide which knobs to turn for their particular scheduling needs. The programmer doesn't need to care about the details.</p>
<p>Another example is search autocomplete, which is surprisingly hard. Need to decide how often to send requests (throttle them to be not per-key) and also deal with concurrent responses from keypresses coming in out of order.</p>
<pre>var res = 
  keyPresses.throttle(20).flatMap(
    search =&gt; 
      getSearchResults(search).takeUntil(keypresses));

res.forEach(resultSet =&gt; listBox.setItems(resultSet)</pre>
<p>This code fragment does all this composably and handles all that logic. It's throttled, ordered correctly and terminates until the keypresses stop (with respect to the throttling policy.</p>
<p>The full tier is a UI (huge amount of mutable state), dropping in to a distributed functional style, and heading into the data tier. Recall this is at huge scale.</p>
<p>Wins: Rx is open sourced from MS and ported to Java (Observable) and generally better tooled now.<br />Evangelism comes up again since you can't assume the best technical solution will win. Practice public speaking and focussing on soft skills! Speaker got better in a short amount of time at distilling the essence of the benefits, and explaining to the target audience why something matters (e.g. to a UI developer vs a cloud developer as he explained earlier).</p>
<p>Challenges: Training/Hiring. Netflix didn't fire all their UI developers as the previous speaker did (audience laughter). Instead, they leveraged their skills at eking out mobile performance, and taught them alternatives: functional programming, vector programming and reactive programming. Be available to help out people (developers work weird hours!) and interactive training exercises really help too. Also help them understand <i>when</i> to apply each technqique for a particular programming task.</p>
<p>Some of the Javascript programmers had some intuition for these techniques from things like Promises. It wasn't quite the right answer, as sometimes you need vector versions for performance instead (since it degenerates to a scalar version by passing a vector of size 1). Netflix dont bother teaching scalar, only vector.</p>
<p>Although the programmers are used to mapreduce, the embedded version of this is a lot harder for them to grasp -- it's just a programming style and not just magic in Hadoop. Hiring process adapts to spot the competent functional programmer.</p>
<p>bind/flatMap/concatMap/mapcat/mapMany are all monadic versions with subtle semantics and so they use interactive training exercises to train developers in their runtime semantics.</p>
<p>Challenges: performance needs some chunking for lowend devices (vector a manually chunked scalar monad) and is best applied to less chatty event streams. It worked for search on lowend devices since it takes so damn long to type anything in, so a less chatty UI stream (audience laughter). "We are screwed if the hardware UIs improve".</p>
<p>Type-unsafe flatMap is easier to understand but needs to be used carefully, but is useful on lowend deviecs.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">http://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS</a> has all the source, so give it a try!</p>
<p>Q: How do Databinding in Rx?<br />A: No templates, but many other tiers before the view layer are bound together. We introduce an Observable with both pure and impure code (an Observable type with a value property). However they learnt how to do this directly since Observable's lazy default is the wrong for data binding. Implementing a different type that is strict and publishes the result directly.</p>
<h3>Medical Device Automation using message passing concurrency in Scheme</h3>
<p>What does a molecular diagnostic device do and what does Scheme have to do with all this?</p>
<p>Detects the presence of specific strands of DNA/RNA in sample and then does necleic acid extractions and purification. Sample are excited using lasers as they undergo PCR which results in spectrographs.<br />Device contains 19 boards with temp, motor control with many parts that move simultaneously at very high precisions. (author shows demos of the motors running and playing music from the system!)</p>
<p>Client is written in C# and WPF and is thin/stateless. Sever is written in Scheme and Erlang with OTP embedded. Supervision structure to isolate hardware failures. A DSL provides the glue logic.</p>
<p>Scheme is exceptionally clear and simple syntax, and they love the hygeinic syntactic abstractions for their DSL and the first-class functions and continuations are key. Arbitrary precision arithmetic is important for result calculations.</p>
<p>The Erlang embedding in Scheme is how they interop. They embed records by referring to structured data by field name instead of field index. This allows for copying a record and changing particular fields.</p>
<p>There's no pattern matching built into Scheme and enables matching on all the usual datatypes (strings, lists, vectors and records). It also allows matching the value against a local variable and/or binding values to local variables in the pattern itself, which is new in Scheme (but quite ML-like? -- editor)</p>
<p>Processes are on-shot continuations with software timer interrupts. The Gen-server patterns provide a functional way of serializing messages and mutating state. The init/handle-call/handle-cast/handle-info and terminate are all encoded, and so it's all done except code-change (the FDA wouldnt appreciate code changing on the fly!)</p>
<p>The event manager is responsible for event logging and subscriptions, and supervisors monitor processes and execute a restart or clean shutdown semantic (with enough logging for a field debug cycle).</p>
<p>How it works in the instrument server: "let is crash" throughout and a notable lack of defensive programming due to the actor model. They manage some big hardware which fails all the time and this architecture directly addresses that reality.</p>
<p>Easy assay is executed via a DSL which defines the pipeline in a <i>confirm mode</i> to estimate running time, suggest missing resources and warn about a lack of timeslots. Once satisfied this is all taken care of, the queuing is done via a Tetris-style binpacking heuristic. Each action has its own process for fault tolerance. The DSL exposes an option to ignore action failures which is important for test runs and debugging (also during hardware development).</p>
<p>Some examples of device failures are very bad: <b>Therac 25</b> was a RTOS that gave people fatal radiation doses. It was tracked down to bad use of mutable state and integer overflow (taken care of in their system with FP and arbitrary precision math). <b>Ariane 5</b> was due to interger overflow due to conversion precision, which also doesn't happen in their Scheme system which has non-lossy conversion. And finally the space shuttle simulator crashed due to memory unsafety (a restart was unclean), which cannot happen in Scheme. The supervision hierarchy in Erlang/Scheme can handle crashes with a stable strategy at any layer.</p>
<p>Why a DSL? The assay developers need to write their own recipes such as "which recipes for this instrument, and in which order?". The scientists shouldn't need software engineers to help them work, so the DSL sorts that out. Mechanical engineers need to check reliability and timing/variability on the hardware, which they can do by configuring DSL parameters.</p>
<p>There are a few bits to the DSL: an extraction/purification language (tip loading, pipetting, moving magnets) and the protocol language (aspirating, dispensing, etc) and finally the motor language.</p>
<p>Shows an example of the PCR language, which is a complex recipe involving baking, thermal cycling in loops. The DSL follows the logic flow of the English language version of the recipe very closely (with more brackets).</p>
<p>Wrote a web server that supports HTTP requests and JSON/jQuery and an sexpression-based HTML code generator. Can render pages with Scheme logic and render to webbrowsers. Use by engineers for debugging and prototyping without having to touch the real UI, and non-engineers use it to map data sources from instruments into JSON (which can be fed into validation tools, for example to send to the FDA for regulation).</p>
<p>Lessons learnt:</p>
<ul><li>Message passing is great but not a silver bullet. Gen servers can deadlock between each other despite being deadlock free internally. Timeouts in genservers and supervisor logging makes this possible to catch at a higher level, which is crucial!</li>
<li>Not much on the web about a design pattern for the supervisor structure, so they had to pioneer it (didnt really want to pioneer it though)</li>
<li>Automated unit test frameworks also built by them by hand</li>
<li>Hiring remains hard into this unique environment.</li>
<li>Existing quality metrics like bug density are problematic, since Scheme is terse and so looks artificially worse than more verbose languages!</li>
<li>FDA has more scrutiny into this system since this is different from the usual C/C++/C# codebases and also the large number of open source tools such as Sqlite/Emacs/git. Unique to this regulated problem space of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Message passing concurrency makes reasoning about semantics of concurrent process easier, ass well as debugging problems via fault isolation. Let-it-crash leads to shorter, less defensive code with fewer branch points and test cases. Strong typing and runtime checks provide cognizant failure instead of silent corruption (crucial to avoid in this medical space).</p>
<p>Mixing languages has been nice, since they can pick the good bits of Scheme (macros, arbitrary precision math) and Erlang (OTP). DSLs provide the glue here, and rapid prototyping for non-expert software developers.</p>
<h2>Gilt and Scala microengines</h2>
<p>Clothing group, and they need to customize the website with per-user targetting. The customer facing stuff is the tip of the iceberg with a bunch of backoffice features that need to be plumbed through. The traffic patterns are all about flash traffic that spike massively during sales, and if they go down in these times they lose lots of money.</p>
<p>Gilt is about six years old, and it was built as a Rails app in the beginning that was quite large. It had unclear ownership, complex dependencies, lengthy test cycles, and unexpected performance impacts from small changes. Rails encourages to "throw everything into one directory -- a thousands models in one directory" which is really unscalable as the number of engineers grew. Some bad production issues came out of this problem.</p>
<p>Then they started to transition to microservices by transitioning a few core critical pieces into microserviecs such as inventory management. The number of services grew to over 300 services in just 4 years (each HTTP microprotocols), all built using Scala. They developed an architecture to support this sort of growth of microservices.</p>
<p>Cornerstones of infrastructure (goal==cool stuff for customers!)</p>
<ul><li><b>Build system:</b> SBT is a "simple build tool" which then turned into "Scala build tool" due to its complex mental model. Configuring everything correctly can be tricky if you have a number of dependencies. Gilt wanted to abstract developers from this so they could focus on writing appliction code. They solved it via a large SBT plugin that takes care of dependency management that provides a standardized configuration for everything.<br />A complete build specification is shown which is very succinct: it just has a combinator for adding dependencies. Behind the scenes, the plugin provides a huge amount of support (testing, rpms, dependency, continuous builds, and many more)</li>
<li><b>Configuration</b> is handled by a Zookeeper cluster and can be overridden with local files or system properties. It's mapped into strongly-typed classes in Scala and validated via Hibernate so that configuration must match up with service expectations.</li>
<li><b>Testing</b> is the most challenging part of a microservice architecture. Functional tests are the gold standard, but hard for developers to run 300 services on their local laptops. Unit tests can run locally, but there's no mocking service for these (and overmocking results in useless testing that in non representative). They use the Cake pattern for dependency injection, which enables type-safe and scalable composition. It uses Scala's self-types and multiple trait inheritance. Things like object repositories or configuration providers can be expressed in this way. The pattern lets them mixin different sources and weave in real/mocked sources.<b>UI Testing</b> is handled via Selenium and is built on ScalaTest. Automated browser testing with reusable components works well, and leverages Scala's type system well to reject invalid tests/code/configuration.</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery lets them deliver 20 to 30 service versions every day using the aforementioned structures</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cool stuff: on their website, there are badges on their website showing inventory for each item. The inventory badges update in realtime as you look at the page, which really motivates people to buy as they spot inventory dropping down. Shoppers get excited and feel like they're in a Black Friday sale and are engaged in the shopping activity! Building this stuff was quite easy to do using event-driven Play application and Akka actors.</p>
<p>They build on this for "freefall sales". Essentially a Dutch auction and is also web sockets and Play based. It initiates a sale that lasts for a fixed time with the price dropping regularly. The highlight is a $16000 purse that leads to audience laughter.</p>
<p>Q: how to deal with production side of microservices such as service discovery or log aggregation?<br />A: no service discovery as Zookeeper tracks where everything is (which ports something is on). Log aggregation isnt great at the moment, so they're working on centralized collection atm.</p>
<p>Q: what's the greatest win of FP here? Is type safety really important or something like that?<br />A: in the context of the company development and the technical stack, one nice thing about Scala is that it combines the "good parts" of Ruby (concise, expressive) with type safety and performance (as they had in Java). Scala provided a balance between Java and Ruby by giving them type safety, performance and conciseness, which is a big win in terms of expressivity and reuse of components.</p>
<p>Q: how do you handle versioning of microservices?<br />A: each service maintains back compat in its API until they ensure all their clients are upgraded. The URI path has the version number, so service providers bump the version number for new clients and keep the old version working. They then migrate all the clients of the service as quickly as is practical.</p>
<h2>PalletOpts and infrastructure automation</h2>
<p>(I missed a lot of this talk due to a lunch chat spilling over. I'll fill it in later --editor)</p>
<p>A Clojure DSL that runs shell scripts and handles very complex infrastructure automation.</p>
<p>Q: Yaron: How do you handle error propagation through scripts (the equiv of set -e in sh)<br />A: Each combinator propagates errors and there are different run strategies that handle errors differently depending on needs.</p>
<h2>Streaming data at Twitter with Summingbird</h2>
<p>Speaker is <a href="http://twitter.com/sritchie">@sritchie</a> (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sritchie/summingbird-at-cufp">his slides</a>). <a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-3.jpg"><img alt="photo 3" class="size-medium wp-image-1399 alignright" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-3-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Summingbird is how to do streaming Map Reduce at the scale they have at Twitter (scale is "staggering"). It has been open sourced since Sep 3rd and a bunch of internal systems at Twitter run on it. Mainly three people: @posco @sritchie and Ashu -- small teams.</p>
<p><b>Vision</b>:</p>
<ul><li><b>"Write your logic once"</b>: Twitter has a number of 1000+ host Hadoop clusters and a lot of their data is done via k/v processing with Hadoop. Going streaming had to be done evolutionary by letting it be done either on Hadoop or on some new streaming service. Programmers experimenting with data shouldn't have to make systems decisions early on in the process. Twitters scale: 200m+ active users, 500M tweets/day and scale is pervasive.</li>
<li><b>Solve systems problems once</b> so that systems that are scaling stay fixed.</li>
<li><b>Make non-trivial realtime compute as accessible as Scalding</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads onto Summingbird: a declarative map/reduce streaming DSL. It's a realtime platform that runs on Storm, and a batch platform that runs on Hadoop. The datastructures that come out of the DSL can be run on either platform (so you can choose between batch/streaming very late in the process).</p>
<p>One of the big concepts that Summingbird embraces is the idea of "associative plus" operations -- the monoid.<br />The 4 S' of Summingbird ("you know you're onto something when they all have something in common!"):</p>
<pre>Source[+T]
Store[-K,V]
Sink[-T]
Service[-K,+V]</pre>
<p>Source is where data comes from, Store is a k/v store that is being aggregated into. Sink is a dump as processing items, and Service permits k/v lookups during a job.</p>
<p>Store: what values are allowed? What constraints can we place on a MR job such that any valid value can make progress.</p>
<pre>trait Monoid[V] {
  def zero: V
  def plus(l:V, r:V):V
}</pre>
<p>"less scary than a monad!". If you can take any two values and smash them together, you have a monoid -- e.g. integers. Also Sets have a monoid (concat) and lists (concat) and maps (recursively pull in the monoid on the value). Others include: HyperLogLog, CMS, ExponentialMA, BloomFilter, Moments,MinHash,Topk. All you need to do is find a datastructure with a monoid and you can use Summingbird. There is an open source library called Algebird (birds birds birds!).</p>
<p>It took some convincing (the words like "monoid" still scared people at Twitter, sadly).</p>
<p>Monoids are amazing due to Associativity. If you know that the values you are reducing are associative, then it's easy to parallelise since they can be built "in any order".</p>
<p>Even though realtime is important at Twitter, noones wanted to dip in due to the difficulty of getting started. Summingbird can pull in data from an existing static Hadoop cluster and then union it with a realtime feed. If you give the logic to Summingbird, it will run the logic on Hadoop (consuming discrete batches of data) and the client will keep track of how far it's gone. The realtime comes from partial aggregations over fixed time buckets, and is merged together in the client using the monoid to aggregate them together to look like a proper realtime feed.</p>
<p>One cool feature: when you visit a tweet, you want the reverse feed of things that have embedded the tweet. The MR graph for this comes from: when you see an impression, find the key of the tweet and emit a tuple of the tweetid and Map[URL,Long]. Since Maps have a monoid, this can be run in parallel, and it will contain a list of who has viewed it and from where. The Map has a Long since popular tweets can be embedded in millions of websites and so they use an "accountment sketch" which is an approximate data structure to deal with scale there. The Summingbird layer which the speaker shows on stage filters events, and generates KV pairs and emits events.</p>
<p>Twitter advertising is also built on Summingbird. Various campaigns can be built by building a backend using a Monoid that expresses the needs, and then the majority of the work is on the UI work in the frontend (where it should be -- remember, solve systems problems once is part of the vision).</p>
<p>Future plans:</p>
<ul><li>Akka, Spark, Tez platforms</li>
<li>Pluggable graph optimizations since various planners do improved filter push</li>
<li>Metadata publishing with HCatalog -- in OSS, this means better tooling for EC2 and other cloud platforms.</li>
<li>And of course, more tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>All work happens on Github so contributors are welcome.</p>
<p>Summingbird is working well for the majority of realtime apps at Twitter. It's all about the Monoid! Data scientists who arent familiar with systems can deploy realtime systems, and 90%+ of the code is reused across the realtime and batch systems.</p>
<p>Q: Did Hadoop need any changes to cope with the interfacing with Summingbird.<br />A: Scalding (written at Twitter) handles much of the interfacing with Hadoop. Hadoop is really the classical k/v store now. Real problem is figuring out which operations can work on both the batch and realtime and only admitting realtime.</p>
<p>Q: Yaron: associativity is one nice thing about Monoid, but what about commutativity is also important. Are there examples of non-commutative datastructures<br />A: Good examples. It should be baked into the algebra (non-commutativity). This helps with data skew in particular. An important non-commutative application is Twitter itself! When you want to build the List monoid, the key is userid,time and the value is the list of tweets over that timeline (so ordering matters here). It's not good to get a non-deterministic order when building up these lists in parallel, so that's a good example of when associativity and commutativity are both important.</p>
<h2>Functional Probabilistic Programming</h2>
<p>Avi from Charles River, introducing the Figaro language.</p>
<p><b>Problem</b>: Suppose you have some information ("suppose Brian ate pizza last night") and you want to answer some questions based on this ("is Brian a student or a programmer?") and keep track of the uncertainty in the answers.</p>
<p><b>Solution</b>: Create a joint probability distribution over the variables, assert the evidence and use probabilistic inference to get the answer back.</p>
<p>One common way to do this generative models. Probabilistic models in which variables are generated in order. Later values can depend on previous variables with a binding. This is a v popular approach with several implementations available over the years.</p>
<p>Developing a new model requires figuring out a representation, an inference algorithm and a learning algorithm. All of these are significant challenges with each of them still being considered paper-worthy.</p>
<p>The dominant paradigm is functional probabilistic programming. An expression describes a computation that produces a value.</p>
<pre>let student = true in
let programmer = student in
let pizza = student &amp;&amp; programer in 
(student, programmer, pizza)

let student = flip 0.7 in
let programmer = if student flip(0.2) else flip(0.1) in
let pizza = if student &amp;&amp; programmer flip(0.9) else flip(0.3)
(student, programmer, pizza)</pre>
<p>How are we supposed to understand this kind of program. Sampling semantics: run this program many times, each with a sample outcome. In each run, each outcome has some probability of being generated. The program defines a probability distribution over all the outcomes.</p>
<p>This is a powerful approach since we are taking a Turing powerful language and probabilistic primitives are added, and this naturally expresses a wide range of models.</p>
<p>Structured variable elimination, Markov chain Monte Carlo, importance sampling and so forth can all be built using functional probabilistic programming. PPLs aim to "democratize" model building -- one shouldn't need extensive training in ML or AI to build such models, or use them effectively.</p>
<p>IBAL (2000-2007) is the first practical PPL, implemented in OCaml but not embedded in OCaml. Exact inference using structured variable elimination and later had intelligence important sampling. However, it was hard to integrate it with applications and data (in IBAL the data had to be hardcoded into the data, which wasnt practical). It also lacked continuous variables. Therefore the speaker built Figaro to work around the limitations.</p>
<p>Figaro (2009-present) is a EDSL in Scala and allows distributions over any data type. It has a highly expressive constraint system that allows it to express non-generative models. There is an extensible library of inference algorithms that contains many of the popular probabilistic inference algorithms (eg. variable elimination).</p>
<p>The goals of Figaro are to implement a PPL in a widely used library: Scala is the interop language as Java compat is a prime goal. Figaro provides various good abstractions such as OO that come out of Scala (not sure, he skipped slide rapidly here? -- editor)</p>
<p>Figaro has an <code>Element[T]</code> which is a class of probablistic models over type T. Atomic elements (Constant,Flip, Uniform, Geometric) are combined with compound elements <code>(If (Flip(0.9), Constant(0.5)...)</code>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, there is a probability monad to track the state. The Constant is the monadic unit and Chain(T,U) implements the monadic bind. Apply(T,U) implements monadic fmap. Most elements in Figaro are implemented using this monad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-4.jpg"><img alt="photo 4" class="size-medium wp-image-1400 alignright" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-4-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Example 1: Probabilistic walk over a graph. In Figaro, we start by defining datastructures over the webpage graph (Edge, Node, Graph) and then we define some parameters of the random walk.</p>
<p>Example 2: Friends and smokers. Create a person with a smokes variable. Friends are three times as likely to have the same smoking habit than different, so this is a constraint variable. Finally this is applied to all pairs of friends by adding constraints to the pairs. This is then instantiated in a particular situation by building a set of people (alice, bob, clara) and running the inference algorithm (VariableElimination) to calculate the probability that Clara smokes.</p>
<p>Example 3: Hierarchical reasoning. We observe an object (say a vehicle on a road, or a person, or something) and we want to know what type of object it is. We have some observations about this object (its size, color or shape) and we want to know if its something we should be interested in. It's very natural to think of these objects via an inheritance hierarchy. In Figaro, every element has a name and belongs to an element collection. A reference is a sequence of names (such as vehicle size). Starting with an element collection, we can get to the vehicle associated with an element (go through through the sequence of nested element collections). However, there may be uncertainty in the identity of a reference (e.g. you dont know what vehicle1 is). Figaro resolve the element to the actual element.</p>
<p>Obtaining Figaro is free and open source (cra.com/figaro) but v2 is on GitHub (like everything else today, it seems).</p>
<p>Q: What are the limitations of Figaro, such as non-terminating Bernoulli tasks and what constraints cant be encoded?<br />A: Anything you can express can be put in constraints since any code can go in there. It's very easy to express something that you cant compute. Figaro is working on helping the programmer that can be computed over, such as via rejection sampling or simply rejecting the bad constraint.</p>
<p>Q: Similar to Norman Ramsey's work (such as Church), whats the relationship<br />A: The languages fall into categories: their own languages and embedded libraries. The latter is Figaro and Infer.NET and Factory. INFER.NET is limited in expressivity and so can be compiled into a factor graph so is very efficient. Similarly Factory is lowlevel and compiles to factor graph. Lots to discuss here.</p>
<h2>Haskell and FPComplete</h2>
<p>Company exists to fix Haskell development tools. All the tools are cloud-based and run in a web browser. Content can be browsed anonymously. This talk will not have the Monad word in it!<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo4.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1425" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo4-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>There exists a feature to create tutorials and embed code within those tutorials.</p>
<p>Latest product (being announced today) is a Haskell IDE that is a web based tool which requires no setup and no download. It has a number of cool features:</p>
<ul><li>Errors are displayed immediately as it compiled as you type</li>
<li>Git based so full version control</li>
</ul>
<p>Company goals: increase Haskell adoption and make it more accessible. Offer commercial grade tools and support and simplify Haskell development. Also to support the Haskell community and leverage the community to improve FP Complete's own products.</p>
<p>The FP Haskell Center (released in Sep 2013) has:</p>
<ul><li>a web front end (no setup,access to help and integrated with Haskell)</li>
<li>Haskell backend has project management, developer feedback with errors, build system and a cloud based execution and deployment platform. The cloud allows for faster product evolution!</li>
<li>Soon to have a personal version and version that will work behind firewalls etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is all implemented in a Haskell web framework like Yesod. Lots of library support via conduits, and the UI uses Javascript (via Fay). All the heavy lifting is done in the backend and not via Javascript. Very few issues surfaced using Yesod and no major modifications were required to build their product.</p>
<p>Challenges were outside the scope of Haskell usually, but Haskell was used to fix them.</p>
<ul><li>Javascript coding was significant in the frontend</li>
<li>Stable set of libraries are important</li>
<li>Compiler integration (feedback and errors) must be available as a library to let the IDE spot identifier location problems</li>
<li>Uses LXC containers to created isolation containers -- ephemeral storage and containers can run on either shared or dedicated systems.</li>
<li>IDE uses isolation git state to separate users from each other. When projects are created, there is a visual representation of projects (in git repositories each, in S3) and each repo is accessed via Gitlib-2. Interesting is that this offers multiple backends for git access: Git C library, GitHub C library, IDE local repo in S3 or others in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>For building projects, code is being precompiled continuously in the backend and so bytecode can generated quickly and run within the IDE. Bytecode runs in the GHC frontend container and exceptions dont break the IDE. Keter and Chef provide deployment assistance to get it into a shared application server or container, and FP Complete offers this deployment as part of their product.</p>
<p>Billing Processor provides SOAP APIs. Added SOAP Haskell libraries to Haskell via C++ bindings.</p>
<h2>Mobile gaming from Japan</h2>
<p>They normally built mobile games using Ruby, PHP, etc, but have switched to FP in recent years for reliability, high performance and productivity. However, they've suffered from memory leak (blaming Haskell's laziness, to audience laughter), and some data loss and performance degradation.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo3.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1424" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo3-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Gree is one of the largest mobile games platforms, with 37 million users and 2000 games as of June 2013. They develop social games and a platform for 3rd party games. They also do social media and advertising and licensing, and also venture capital.</p>
<p>Employees are 2582 with a significant number of engineers (cant disclose exact numbers). On client side, it's normally Java, ObjC, Javascript and Unity/C#. Server side is usually PHP, MySQL and Flare (a KV store written in C++ developed internally at Gree). They started a Haskell project in Jun 2012 and they have 6 Scala and 4 Haskell engineers.</p>
<p>They developed a KVS management system using Haskell, to setup and destroy KVS nodes in response to hardware faults and sudden access spikes. It's used in a large social game application. Another example is an image storage gateway, which converts WebDAV to memcached/S3 for the SNS photo uploader to store images. It uses Warp and http-conduit to do this conversion.</p>
<p>Some pitfalls they faced with Haskell:</p>
<ul><li>Memory leaks via lazy evaluation: frontend server keeps a list of active thread ids in a TVar for monitoring. When deleting from the thread list, the function didnt reduce the function to a normal form and so held onto a reference. This led to a serious memory leak that took the service down. It was fixed easily by evaluating to the normalform and forcing sequentialisation. They felt it is too easy to mix up TVar/MVar writes with other IO operations (which do reduce to normal form and avoid the leak). There is much confusion over the strict/lazy alternatives for non-IO functions</li>
<li>Race conditions: Data put in a queue is very rarely lost. The reason is that the timeout functions can be used only once safely with an IO function. (details omitted)</li>
<li>Performance degradation: from forking a lot of threads to do monitoring. This was easy to fix but happens often since Haskell libraries are developed actively and the implications of changes are not always obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to fix all this? Better <b>testing</b> to start with. Haskell has a great QuickCheck framework and they developed HUnit. This lets services be started in the setup (in their example, memcached using a spare port), and then run services against it and make sure its torn down in a timely fashion. They used this to extensively test their KVS system and Flare (written in C++). Over 150 system tests and a control server with 5000+ assertions, so this is a big scale test.</p>
<p>Next up is documentation in Haskell. A problem report describes details of the problem and linked from a bug tracker. The timeline, workaround, impact and details caused must all be captured and are mixed up with a number of other reports, so none of the Haskell people read it. They collected up the aggregation and summarised it for other Haskell products. Despite this, other Haskell programmers still dont read it (audience laughter). To sort this out, they do automated checking using hlint. They customize hlint to "grep" for their particular pitfall, and then check for Emacs. hlint isnt quite good enough for a lot of their pitfalls though, such as the timeout issue from earlier, so they had some workarounds to deal with this. The good thing is that hlint is integrated into their text editor. Not all pitfalls can be caught by hlint: high level design issues will remain problematic.</p>
<p>Education is also important. They have a brown bag (lunch? -- editor) FP meeting where they "Make GREE a better place through the power of FP". They cover both Scala and Haskell topics. They also run an education program for new graduates, and they have a Haskell code puzzle series from Project Euler to help the new graduates.</p>
<p>They conclude that they love FP and they develop some key components of our service using FP. But there are many pitfalls, and they are developing tools to assist them sort them out.</p>
<h2>Haskell for distributed systems</h2>
<p>Jeff Epstein (formerly a masters student in the Cambridge SRG, so it's good to see him again!) talks about their new distributed system that they are building in Haskell. His company is also available for hiring!<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo5.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1428" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo5-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>HA middleware manages networked clusters, aiming for exabyte-scale clusters. It's architected by Mathieu Boespflug and Peter Braam (who has spoken about their FPGA work <a href="http://cufp.org/videos/parallel-scientific-awesome-haskell-fpga-compiler">at past CUFPs</a>). It manages 10000+ nodes and creates consensus in the cluster about the location of active services. It can handle events due to failures, recovery time should be approx. 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Zookeeper didn't scale <i>(audience interruption: why didnt Zookeeper scale? Jeff says he doesn't know and should chat offline, audience member notes that they maintain Zookeeper and wants to know more)</i>.</p>
<p>Events are sent by nodes and aggregated at a proxy node, and enqueued at an HA station. Events are processed by the hA coordinator and updates a node state graph (which is also replicated -- everything is replicated and is a key theme in the talk). The HA coordinator is the decision maker which decides what to do on failure. Its main action is updating the node state graph to reflect the new strategy after failure.</p>
<p>Key components are: Haskell, Cloud Haskell and Paxos.</p>
<p>How we used Haskell:</p>
<ul><li>Functional Data structures result in a purely functional graph and replicated (impurely) between cluster managers. Most of the feels imperative though, which was important.</li>
<li>Refactoring being easier was important due to strong typing.</li>
<li>Laziness was yet again a problem causer in IO due to space leaks in low-level networking code. He notes that distribution is a natural barrier to laziness, since the act of serializing a message forces its evaluation. He also notes that processes much behave the same between processes on the same host as between hosts, and so even local communication must be forced.<i>Phil Walder interjects to ask "why did you use Haskell? It's a bad fit! Jeff replies that "we like Haskell"</i> and introduces Cloud Haskell, the topic of his MPhil thesis.Cloud Haskell is a library for distributed concurrency in Haskell and provides an actor-style message-passing interface, similarly to Erlang. It provides a "typed erlang".Cloud Haskell is a good fit for this project in terms of interacting communicating components. Refactoring is easy, and this isn't a "big data" project in the sense of data size. There is a huge amount of communication messages though.CH has a pluggable transport layer such as TCP, but also for different underlying networks (they built Infiniband). However, CH requires ordered delivery of packets and this was a poor fit (they want out of order delivery, which could be built with UDP, but CH requires an ordering for some reason). Space leaks are a real problem in this layer.Cluster bringup is tough for CH, since nodes need to find each other at start of day, and there some hacks in there to work around a morning storm of messages.<i>(Interjection from audience: why not use Erlang? Jeff: performance wasnt up to par, and static types are important for them). Possibly the native code / bytecode erlang might be useful but speaker wasn't sure if it would work.</i>
<p>Paxos: is all about making systems agree (well-known proven algorithm for consensus). They implemented this as a general purpose library on top of CH. The algorithm is a good match for the programming model, with the client, acceptor, proposer learning and leader all built as CH processes. It ended up being a small readable implementation (1.5kLOC) that closely matched the pseudocode in the original Paxos paper (made them feel better about correctness). It's used for synchronizing the state graph and for the distributed message queue.</p>
<p>Challenges: Paxos is hard and untyped messages in CH make it worse. Getting reasonable performance from it also requires the modified variants. Liveness also is tricky to avoid overapproximations to prevent nodes being fenced out of the consensus unnecessarily. Multipaxos is something that solves some of this, and they're working on more specific stuff also.</p>
<p>Debugging: The CH programming model makes it tractable to debug a distributed application on a single machine. Nevertheless, distributed code is still parallel and involves race conditions and mixing messages. They would like a distributed <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/ThreadScope">ThreadScope</a> but instead mainly used oldskool logging.</p>
<p>They did build a deterministic CH thread scheduler to replace CH's core message handling primitives, and they also used PROMELA</p>
<p>Q: how much is open source or will be?<br />A: none as far as speaker knows</p>
<p>Q: Marius: how are non-deterministic sources composed with the deterministic scheduler?<br />A: deterministic scheduler is for testing only, so timeouts also so deterministic.</p>
<h2>IQ: Functional Reporting</h2>
<p>Speaker is Edward Kmett on how they got FP in the door at S&amp;P Capital in the door, their extensions to Haskell and generally how they're working on opensourcing their tech. SAP is huge and have a number of products (S&amp;P Capital IQ Platform, ClariFI, AlphaWorks, Compustat).<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo6.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1434" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo6-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Getting FP in the door:</p>
<ul><li>Monoids (introduced as with the Summingbird talk, for easy parallelisation)</li>
<li>Reducers are another really powerful abstraction which can take a container full of values and give you back a structure, and it has a comonadic structure that lets you (e.g.) pass it many containers full of structures and generally compose things nicely. Reduction can also be done simultaneously across monoidal structures and essentially "we dont see the wiring hanging out of our code any more".</li>
<li>Performance attribution: This is a model that breaks down the reasons why you make money (what did you do that was significant). The old and busted model (implemented in Java, full dataset in memory, hard to extend) was horrible, and the new hotness is implemented in Scala, runs in constant space, is really fast and results are flattened elegantly via combinators to a database backend. In other words: better, but some details are glossed over (multipass algorithms, iteratees, caching layers, and handling missing data) -- but all this was sorted out and really sold Scala to the bigger company as a real asset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They developed Ermine, which is Haskell with Row Types. It's not quite Haskell, but it's main feature is that it's not Scala either (audience laughter). Writing functional programs in Scala is quite painful (e.g. not blowing stack with monads requires trampolining everything and is labour intensive just to get by day to day). They wrote Ermine in both Scala and Haskell with a portable Core that can run on the JVM.</p>
<p>Ermine has a strong type system, with novel row types and polymorphic and constraint kinds ("they were just coming into GHC at the time and I wanted to understand them") and Rank-N types via a derivative of HMF. It fit their domain requirements really wel, and has builtin database support, can be exposed to end users, a structured code editor that can only generate type-safe code as you're defining, and full control over error messages.</p>
<p>Row types are a powerful way of describing the presence of a particular field. Its modelled via has, lacks and/or subsumes constraints. This is easily checked, but now inference flows unidirectionally through a join.<br />In Ermine, they have existentials in their constraint types <i>(technical explanation follows, not shown here --editor)</i>.</p>
<p>Their reporting layer has one declarative specification to do all the relational algebra specifications they want, and push it into specific backends (SQL Server, etc) and ensure they run their queries as close to the data as possible. They can also create extensive HTML reports that render pretty consistently across different target platforms. Their example of Ermine was written by a functional programmer that had done no functional programming previously, which required a little hand holding to work through some of the more obscure type errors, but generally it worked ok.</p>
<p>All the code is being stuck onto Hackage/Github etc.</p>
<p>Q: has it been rolled out to a lot of users?<br />A: being used on the main S&amp;P website. One big client facing page for users. The next gen stuff is using Ermine more widely. The desktop app coming soon has Ermine and will be used by a huge number of users. Trend is to use it in an increasing number of their products.</p>
<h2>Enterprise scheduling with Haskell at skedge.me</h2>
<p>They have a cloud-based scheduling platform that takes care of complex enterprise scheduling. It has a branded customer experience (like Google Apps does), a flexible workflow and deep integration with backend systems and in-store workflow (e.g. on iPads).<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo7.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1445" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo7-300x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Example is Sephora who do makeup, and their appointment system is integrated via skedge.me that is embedded in an iFrame that looks like a seamless part of their site so that endusers cant tell the difference.</p>
<p>When speaker started at skedge.me, there was a lot of fire fighting. It was 43k lines of Groovy on Grails, and several major intractable bugs were affecting the business: timezones, double bookings, recurring events not firing and notifications being delayed. Performance was an issue, as things that were interactive were sometime taking minutes to load. There was also a lot of inflexibility -- hilariously, they had to sometimes ask clients to change their business model to fit with the skedge.me model.</p>
<p>After some careful though, they decided they had to rewrite skedge.me to cope with growth and better service. The author had done Haskell before, but not specifically was with building a website using it.</p>
<p>Haskell had the perfect model for fixing their scaling problems. At the lowest level, they built a RawDB on top of the IO monad that did everything necessary to maintain ACID guarantees during transactions. An example is that once an effect gets committed (e.g. an email gets sent confirming an appointment and then is cancelled, which happened on their old racy platform). This RawDB layer gives them stronger consistency guarantees with tracked effects and automatic retries on temporary failure.</p>
<p>On top of the RawDB, they build a DB monad which provides a higher level than SQL via algebraic data types, caching and data validation. They then layer a security monad on top of the DB monad to guarantee that all accesses have been checked. Finally there is a business logic layer to enforce local policy and customise per customer (which was a real problem in the past).</p>
<p>Security is complex due to all the customization, and they needed roles by client (owner, staff, customer) but also because clients can customise their <i>verbs</i> that only make sense within the component (Appointments can be joined, rescheduled, or notifications can be sent, edit cancelled). Haskell lets all this fit within a multiparameter type class, instead of doing OO-style inheritance that will rapidly get out of control. They map customisations from the customer onto a more standard schema that they can manipulate generically on a component-by-component basis, and it's all statically checked and generally easy to read (important for security critical code).</p>
<p>Haskell "lets them build code for the long run". Sometimes though, you need to write code quickly and not care about longevity. This was the case for the importer, which is a quick-and-dirty hack to get code into their system. It has a limited set of inputs, the "end user" is the developer, and it's thrown away once the job's done. (shows epic type). Often when people need to do this sort of thing, they resort to bash or dynamically typed systems. In this case, even for this "quick hack", they couldnt have achieved what they did "as badly as they did, without the help of the type system". Generally very positive!</p>
<p>Libraries help them not have to write code. Haskell is generally lower in terms of package count, but their *use* of Hackage libraries has been a lot higher than Javascript. They use 9 Javascript libraries, and 71 unique Hackage libraries (+87 dependencies). Its a lot harder to find a quality library that works in the dynamically typed land. Only one of their Haskell libraries had to be replaced due to bugs. This is because Hackage is well-organized, and it's easier to vet a library since the purely functional ones are less risky (fewer sideeffects through other code). In contrast, Javascript libraries can sideeffect (e.g. on the DOM) very late in the QA process. So: fewer Haskell libraries, but the number of useful libraries seems to be higher.</p>
<p>Problems: cyclic module dependencies with hs-boot files are unwieldy, so avoid them. Scalability with 4+cores was limited, but they havent tested GHC 7.8 (which apparently fixes a lot of this). Idle GC can cause issues with long pauses, so disable this feature -- it depends on your workload but it was ok for their server based workload.</p>
<p>Debugging production problems without stack traces is really hard, so consider using profiling mode for all libraries.</p>
<p>Bottom line: 8200 lines of Haskell from 40k+ lines of Groovy. No recurring bugs and very good performance and flexibility for customer needs. Used daily by thousands of people. Check out the <a href="http://skedge.me">website</a>!.</p>
<p>Q: what about testing (QuickCheck?)<br />A: they've done some QuickCheck on critical components (such as an map from times to events). Overall though, just putting Haskell together in the most obvious way led to improvements over their previous platform. Their QA guys are now writing unit tests in Haskell (because their Selenium bindings were harder).</p>
<h2>Integration of Mathematica with MapReduce</h2>
<p>From Paul-Jean Letourneau, a data scientist at Wolfram Research. <i>Started with a show of hands: most of the audience has used Mathematica and had heard of Wolfram.<a href="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo8.jpg"><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1450" src="http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo8-300x300.jpg" /></a></i></p>
<p>The speaker has been responsible for a lot of the personal analytics posts on the Wolfram blog (the email analysis, genomics and several others). The theme of all his projects has been to work on large data. Mathematica has always kept its data oncore, which is a problem with very large data sets, and so this talk is about how they migrate over to a more big-data model to run offcore.</p>
<p>Fundamental principles of Mathematica: everything is an expression, expressions are transformed until they stop changing, and transformation rules are in the form of patterns. Expressions are data structures (actually m-expressions in Lisp parlance). <i>(full explanation of these in Mathematica demonstrated but omitted here)</i></p>
<p>Expressions in Mathematica are immutable data structures ("program as data") and so expressions can be rebound. Homoiconicity is pervasive as expressions are the data structure, even internally during evaluation (where it's represented as a tree).</p>
<p><i>"everything is a one-liner in Mathematica... for a sufficiently long line" (Theo Gray).</i> (audience laughter). He demonstrates some cool oneliners that are Tweetable (&lt;140chars) and demonstrates how to construct an image recursively out of itself (wow).</p>
<p>He views it as a gateway drug to declarative programming</p>
<pre>y = 0
For[i=1; i&lt;=10; i++,y+=i^2]; y
385</pre>
<p>(and then they discover Fold and all the advanced topics such as scoping, evaluation control and the MathLink protocol for IPC).</p>
<p>HadoopLink is how they link Mathmetica to Hadoop. Example is WordCount, wherein he shows code to do it on a single core first (to test the output), and then an export to HDFS so that Hadoop can see the code. This looks fairly straightforward via a DFSExport command from HadoopLik.</p>
<p>The Mapper looks something like:</p>
<pre>Function[{k,v},
  With[{words=ToLowerCase 
    /@ StringSplit [k,RegularExpression[], ...</pre>
<p>The reduces is similar, as it users an iterator to sum up each of the inputs. It actually communicates to the JVM to ensure that they dont have to load all the values into memory. Running the job is just a special HadoopMapReduceJob along with all the relevant expressions, and it goes ahead and submits it to Hadoop.</p>
<p>Used this to build a genome search engine using all this. He shows how to prep data using Mitochondrian genomic data. The mapper only knows about a single base in the genome and its position, and the query sequence, how can it possibly align the query sequence with the genome? Algorithm scales with the size of the query, and not the size of the dataset. Hadoop can be used to handle the full dataset so getting local algorithm right in Mathematica can be focussed on rather than the bigger problem.</p>
<p>Challenges: when this scaled up to search the entire human genome, my Hadoop cluster blows up. Nodes start dying, Nagios alerts, the works! After drilling down on these cryptic errors, the "garbage collector overhead was exceeded" which was hard to interpret. The memory consumption on each worker node when running with both Mathematica and the slave is quite high. This is a setting that's made on a clusterwide basis and so is problematic to tweak just for this. What he'd like to do is add job-specific options to run things like heap size.</p>
<p>Its on GitHub and open source (github.com/shadanan/HadoopLink) so go for it.</p>
<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p>Ashish Agarwal is organizing BoFs! On Monday @ 6pm there will be a bioinformatics session with Jeff Hammerbacher with location on the CUFP website.</p>
<p>On Tuesday there will be a BoF about organizing local events for FP. In the same way that politics is local, this BoF will help you figure out strategies for local events.</p>

<p>The first OCaml Labs compiler hacking session brought together around twenty people from <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/">OCaml Labs</a>, the wider <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Lab</a>, and <a href="http://www.citrix.com/">various</a> <a href="http://www.arm.com/">companies</a> around Cambridge for an enjoyable few hours learning about and improving the OCaml compiler toolchain, fuelled by <a href="http://www.cherryboxpizza.co.uk">pizza</a> and home-made ice cream (thanks, <a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a>!).</p>

<p>We benefited from the presence of a few <a href="http://www.x9c.fr/">experienced</a> <a href="http://danmey.org/">compiler</a> <a href="http://lpw25.net/">hackers</a>, but for most of us it was the first attempt to modify the OCaml compiler internals.</p>

<p>The first surprise of the day was the discovery that work on the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">list of projects</a> was underway before we even arrived!  Keen collaborators from The Internet had apparently spotted our triaged bug reports and <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4323">submitted</a> <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4737">patches</a> to Mantis.</p>

<h3>Standard library and runtime</h3>

<p>There was an exciting moment early on when it emerged that two teams had been working independently on the same issue!  When <a href="https://github.com/jonludlam">Jon Ludlam</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/people/euan.html">Euan Harris</a> submitted a patch to add a <code>get_extension</code> function to the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Filename.html"><code>Filename</code></a> module they found that they had been pipped &#8230;</p><a class="btn planet-toggle" href="#http://ocamllabs.github.com/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013" onclick="switchContent('ocamlorg-post81','ocamlorg-post82')">Read more...</a></div><div id="ocamlorg-post82" style="display: none"><p><img alt="Compiler Hacking" src="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/imgs/2013-09-17.jpg" /></p>

<p>The first surprise of the day was the discovery that work on the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on">list of projects</a> was underway before we even arrived!  Keen collaborators from The Internet had apparently spotted our triaged bug reports and <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4323">submitted</a> <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4737">patches</a> to Mantis.</p>

<h3>Standard library and runtime</h3>

<p>There was an exciting moment early on when it emerged that two teams had been working independently on the same issue!  When <a href="https://github.com/jonludlam">Jon Ludlam</a> and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/people/euan.html">Euan Harris</a> submitted a patch to add a <code>get_extension</code> function to the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Filename.html"><code>Filename</code></a> module they found that they had been pipped to the post by <a href="https://github.com/mcclurmc/">Mike McClurg</a>.  There's still the judging stage to go, though, as the patches wait <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5807">on Mantis</a> for official pronouncement from the Inria team. </p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/vbmithr">Vincent Bernardoff</a> also spent some time improving the standard library, <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4919">fleshing out the interface for translating between OCaml and C error codes</a>, starting from a patch by Goswin von Brederlow.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stedolan">Stephen Dolan</a> looked at a <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=1956">long-standing issue</a> with names exported by the OCaml runtime that can clash with other libraries, and submitted a patch which hides the sole remaining offender for the runtime library.  As he noted in the comments, there are still a <a href="https://gist.github.com/stedolan/6115403">couple of hundred</a> global names without the <code>caml_</code> prefix in the <code>otherlibs</code> section of the standard library.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>There was a little flurry of work on new command-line options for the standard toolchain.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6102">Mantis issue</a> submitted by <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/">Gabriel Scherer</a> suggests adding options to stop the compiler at certain stages, to better support tools such as <a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">OCamlfind</a> and to make it easier to debug the compiler itself.  The Ludlam / Harris team looked at this, and submitted a patch which provoked further thoughts from Gabriel.</p>

<p>Vincent looked at extending <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html">ocamldep</a> with support for suffixes other than <code>.ml</code> and <code>.mli</code>.  Since <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=3725">the issue</a> was originally submitted, <code>ocamldep</code> has acquired <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html#sec288"><code>-ml-synonym</code> and <code>-mli-synonym</code> options</a> that serve this purpose, so Vincent looked at supporting other suffixes in the compiler, and submitted a patch as a <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6110">new issue</a>.</p>

<p>The OCaml top level has a simple feature for setting up the environment &#8212;  when it starts up it looks for the file <code>.ocamlinit</code>, and executes its contents.  It's sometimes useful to skip this stage and run the top level in a vanilla environment, so <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David Sheets</a> submitted a <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6071">patch</a> that adds a <code>-no-init</code> option, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/fadcc73c50b89ca80ecc11131c9a23dbd2c1e67a/Changes#L35">due for inclusion</a> in the next release.</p>

<h3>Error-handling/reporting</h3>

<p>Error handling issues saw a good deal of activity.  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rp452/">Rapha&#235;l Proust</a> submitted a patch to improve the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6112">reporting of error-enabled warnings</a>; David investigated <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=3582">handling out-of-range integer literals</a> and <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5350">return-code checking of C functions in the runtime</a>, leading to some discussions on Mantis.  Stephen submitted a patch to improve the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6182">diagnostics for misuses of <code>virtual</code></a>.  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gk338/">Gabriel Kerneis</a> and Wojciech looked at some <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6109">typos in ocamlbuild error messages</a>, and Mike opened an <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6108">issue to clarify the appropriate use of the <code>compiler-libs</code> package</a>.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>The <code>open</code> operation on modules can make it difficult for readers of a program to see where particular names are introduced, so its use is sometimes discouraged.  The basic feature of making names available without a module prefix is rather useful, though, so various new features (including <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual021.html#toc77">local opens</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/f51bc04b55fbe22533f1075193dd3b2e52721f15">warnings for shadowing</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/a3b1c67fffd7de640ee9a0791f1fd0fad965b867">explicit shadowing</a>) have been introduced to tame its power. Stephen looked at adding a further feature, making it possible to open modules under a particular signature, so that <code>open M : S</code> will introduce only those names in <code>M</code> that are specified with <code>S</code>.  There's an <a href="https://github.com/lpw25/ocaml/tree/signatured-open">initial prototype</a> already, and we're looking forward to seeing the final results.</p>

<p>The second language feature of the evening was support for infix operators (such as the List constructor, <code>::</code>) for user-defined types, a feature that is definitely not in any way motivated by envy of Haskell.  Mike's <a href="https://github.com/mcclurmc/ocaml/tree/infix-constructors">prototype implementation</a> is available, and there's an <a href="https://github.com/mcclurmc/ocaml/pull/1">additional patch</a> that brings it closer to completion.</p>

<h3>Next session</h3>

<p>The next session is planned for 6pm on Wednesday 18th September 2013 at
<a href="http://makespace.org/">Makespace, Cambridge</a>.  If you're planning to come along it'd be
helpful if you could add yourself to the <a href="http://doodle.com/k6y2tiihkrb5vuw4">Doodle Poll</a>.  Hope to see
you there!</p>

<p><strong>Upcoming events</strong> &#8211; Tomorrow is the 2nd <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Makespace/events/138103982/">compiler hacking event</a>, at the <a href="http://makespace.org/">makespace</a>. Anil will be talking at QCon on Mirage, Mirage 1.0 release date is October 22nd, so maybe a workshop before. We 3 talks for Ocaml2013 (Platform, OcamlOT and Ctypes) so here we go &#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>16:09 Anil practice talk on OCaml Platform 1.0</strong></span></p>
<p>Languages take many difference approaches to platform, but what does platform even mean? As a late mover in this field, we can learn from other languages. A platforms is NOT a group of temporarily motivated hackers to build a replacement standard library. Its hard to adopt a particular approach without a domain specific purpose, there are too many opinions, we need objective way to determine what belongs in the platform, we need a genie community that is sustainable (even if a large party leaves). A platform is a bundle of tools that interoperate, with quantitative metric to judge success, built in agility and supporting developers thought the whole development life cycle. Industrial partners have a range of needs, as each work in different domains.</p>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong> &#8211; Overview of 5 areas: OPAM from OCamlPro, IDE Tools, OPAM-DOC, OCaml compiler itself and Ocaml.org.</p>
<p><strong>OPAM</strong> &#8211; 1.1 released today (maybe), over 100 contributors to OPAM, &#160;500+ packages, 1500+ unique versions, external dependency solver using CUDF</p>
<p><strong>IDE Support</strong> &#8211; OCaml has many intermediate files. In OCaml 4.0 onwards, we have a binary format of an abstract syntax tree with type annotations&#160;called cmt (and cmti for interface files), we can now create external tools to query this like opam-doc. ocp-index and ocp-indent from OCamlPro, and Merlin (I thinks this is EPIC)&#160;are also now available</p>
<p><strong>opam-doc</strong> &#8211; Now we have cmt files, we need unified documentation across packages, this is much harder than it sounds as it touches every part of the tool stack. Not all packages can be installed at once due to conflicts. Module inclusion is tough to code in static html. (Need to make a demo) bindoc takes the Typed AST (in cmt) and generates cmd, which include the ocamldoc comments, Opamdoc takes the cmt database for opam and output a single website with your universe of packages.</p>
<p><strong>ocaml.org</strong> &#8211;&#160;Demo of ocaml.org at <a href="http://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/category/pl/ocaml/feed/ocaml-redesign.github.io/pkg/index.html">ocaml-redesign.github.io/pkg/index.html</a>, feedback is welcome says amir</p>
<p>Now we have the tools, what metrics can we extract to see how well our tools are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Portability</strong> &#8211; windows compatibility ?</p>
<p><strong>Maintainer</strong> &#8211; is there a place for docs and will people response to issues/comments/emails, where can issues be submitted ?</p>
<p><strong>Tests</strong> &#8211; code coverage, multi variant benchmarking&#160;in <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core_bench/index.html">core-bench</a></p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong> &#8211; OPAM support pining, how stable are the interfaces of libraries ?</p>
<p>opam tracks compiler constraint, statically analyses the build system from logs (OCamlOT)</p>
<p><strong>Agility</strong> &#8211; Building a platform is EXHAUSTING. We want to ask &#8220;WANT IF&#8221; questions:&#160;<a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/monomorphic_let/">what if let was monomophic</a>? what if we removed <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-camlp4/manual002.html">camlp4</a>? what is the syntax precedence changes ?</p>
<p><strong>Distrusted workflow</strong> &#8211; build on git, distributing tasks between 3 actors: Author (library writers), OCamlOL workers and maintainers. As we become more stable we move from staging to stable to inclusion in the platform.</p>
<p>We are building a tussle, we want to launch a game in janurary and let people put standard libraries into the ring, running OCamlOT to discover the winner</p>
<p><strong>No clear winner</strong>: Lwt &#8211; portability, Batteries &#8211; free of syntax extensions, core &#8211; comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">16:36 &#160;Discussion over the battle of the standard libraries and talk feedback</span></strong></p>
<p>C: talk is a bit long, not sure what to cut..</p>
<p>C: OPAM was dicussed last year at OCaml2013, we want to update everyone and follow on without overlapping too much</p>
<p>Q: Haven&#8217;t we already decided&#160;on JS&#8217;s core ?</p>
<p>A: No, we use all of them, i.e. Mirage used lwt extensively</p>
<p>Q: What if we don&#8217;t want any of the new standard libraries ? maybe I just want to use domain specific libraries from OPAM as and when I need them</p>
<p>A: We are not forcing the new standard libraries on anyone, but they are useful for beginners, nice to have consistent style, interoperability and few open statements e.g. Open Core.Std</p>
<p>Q: What if I have already decided which standard library I want to use ?</p>
<p>A: Again we are not forcing standard libraries on anyone, we are just trying to force effort more directly.&#160;OCaml tools will always be standard library agnoctic</p>
<p>C: the diagram of OCamlOT is confustion</p>
<p>C: how to not overlap with david talks</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>16:41 Davids talk on OCamlOT</strong></span></p>
<p>State for the open source OCaml community</p>
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> what is quality software?&#160;what is the user experience?&#160;what is feedback loop for package authors?&#160;How do we represent the thing underneath this all?&#160;utopian&#160;future ?</p>
<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Work on every core (ANIL: We want multi-core <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" /> ), consistent results: work or die nicely with obvious solution, not more &#8220;What have I forgotten?&#8221; questions, it should just tell you. We need addictive actions (not sure what they are), consistency, quality functions&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Universal concerns:</strong> compiler hypothesis &#8220;what if&#8221; questions (anil already said this), build system hypotheses &#8220;what strange assumuptions is the buid system making?&#8221;, package manager hypothesis&#160;and environmner&#160;hypothesis</p>
<p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Make a pull request, curator observes the proposal, predict the future, proposes amendments, feedback loop and finally agreement is reached. Core is release weekly for example, we are trying to work like linux kernal patches</p>
<p><strong>New workflow:</strong> promote&#160;health of OCaml community,&#160;preaching&#160;compatibility, &#8220;observe, orient, decide and act&#8221;, Computer assisted curator will help a human, to run the loop faster, human can pose questions to the computer assisted curator e.g &#160;&#8220;will this run on ARM ?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Repository Observation:</strong> github binding with web hooks but we are not tied to github. We&#160;merge into the world and we need dependences from each possible users&#160;prospective of the world</p>
<p><strong>Dependency Orientation:</strong> capabilities with environmental&#160;dependances, packages with constriant-based&#160;dependencies, repositories&#160;with revision dependencies and artifact dependencies. example of the android repo</p>
<p><strong>Triage Decisions:</strong> taking plain text error and parsing them into categories such as unsatisfiability (can&#8217;t have these two packages), dependencies (if my dependency is broken, then I am broken), transient (network down), system, metadata, external dependences (you forgot to write a dependency), build errors and a combo of many of the above.</p>
<p><strong>State Action:</strong> commit intention, build, error analysis and buid results</p>
<p><strong>Internet res:</strong> The agents negotiates over REST API on HTTPS, independent metadata layers (not sure about this) ,everythings an s-exp, branch consistent store explained, like git or&#160;<a href="https://github.com/samoht/irminsule">Irminsule</a></p>
<p><strong>Current state:</strong> github web hooks, we are conservative so&#160;one byte changes and we rebuild everything, basic triage heuristics completed, no amendment are proposed by the system atm, we don&#8217;t commit the outcome but the evidence, simple reactions to results, a website with green and red boxes in the large table</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> we have found&#160;lots of metadata issues<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">, many packages bugs, some tool bugs like a non relocatable</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#160;compiler and </span>ocamlbuild<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> PATH </span>ignorer<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">, we currently have 30+ </span>x84-64<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> 30+</span>x84-32<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">, 8 ARMs , many&#160;</span>Linux<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#160;distros</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#160;, </span>dead&#160;<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, panicking<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">&#160;*nix </span>filesystems<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> and lots of people have set warning as error</span></p>
<p><strong>Future:</strong>&#160;opamfu for DAG analysis, schema&#160;migration overhead, lower overhead for administrating exotic workers contributed to OCamlOT, we need to authenticate machines using ocaml-sodium, we need more advanced automation, proposed&#160;amendments, lets have a dialogue, better website integration, benchmarking your upgrades (how much improves cost), run experiments on whole OPAM universe&#160;with differential analysis and VM-based test system, to specific the worker finely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, John Whitington just announced the release of the <a href="http://coherentpdf.com/blog/?p=68">Coherent PDF</a> command-line tools.
Since these are all written in OCaml (and have been developed over quite a few years now), he also sent in an
OPAM <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/977">pull request</a> to add it to the database.
And most conveniently, this ended up solving my little PDF conundrum in less than an hour of hacking, and
has almost cured me of my lifelong fear of dealing with anything in a PDF-like format.  Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>

<ul>  <li>    <p>I installed the tools via <code>opam install cpdf</code>.  This installed the library but not the binary (<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/1100">swiftly fixed</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Reading the license told me that it&#8217;s for non-commercial use only, so I bought a license from the
<a href="http://coherentpdf.com">Coherent PDF</a> website (a bargain price, given how much it does!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>I ran <code>cpdf -list-annotations</code> over the PDF, and it dumped out all the comments as a text file to stdout.
This wasn&#8217;t quite enough for me, since I needed to match the annotation to a page number.  But since
John has released it as open-source, I forked the repository and patched the support directly into the
command-line tools, and sent a <a href="https://github.com/johnwhitington/cpdf-source/pull/2">pull request</a>
back over to John.  Since it&#8217;s under a non-standard license, I decided to place my patch in the public
domain to make it easier for him to accept it if he chooses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>My co-authors can just run <code>opam pin cpdf git://github.com/avsm/cpdf-source#annotation-page-numbers</code>
to pin their local copy of CPDF to my forked branch in their own OPAM installations, and easily use my
copy until John gets a chance to integrate my changes properly upstream.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Total time including this blog post: 40 minutes. Now, onto fixing the author
responses comments for Real World OCaml now.  I&#8217;m so happy to have <code>cpdf</code> as a
simple, hackable PDF utility, as it does things like page combining and rotations
that have always been a little flaky in other tools for me.  It&#8217;s the
<a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> of PDFs!</p>

<h2>Towards a truely portable OCaml</h2>

<p>The upstream OCaml toolchain is built on very UNIX-like principles, with a
number of command-line tools that form a build pipeline.  This process usually
ends with linking the intermediate object files with a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun">runtime library</a> that provides the
garbage collector and other intrinsic OS functions.</p>

<p>Given these raw compiler tools, it&#8217;s very easy to compile OCaml into all
sorts of weird and wonderful architectures.  We&#8217;ve seen it run on
<a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaml_for_pic/web/index.php">8-bit PICs</a>,
several efficient Javascript backends (originally <a href="http://jaked.github.io/ocamljs/">ocamljs</a> and more recently <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml">js_of_ocaml</a>),
and of course my own <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> Xen unikernel.</p>

<p>While the compiler tools themselves are quite portable and work on almost any
UNIX-like system, the build system scaffolding around third-party packages is
less portable.  Some features such as C bindings often contribute to build
breakage on some less-used operating systems such as FreeBSD or OpenBSD, as
they usually require probing for header file locations or adding custom <code>CFLAGS</code>
before building.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Most OCaml developers use x86-based machines and so foreign architectures also
get less day-to-day testing (OCaml has superb support for fast native code
compilation on ARM, PowerPC, Sparc32, and we&#8217;re working on MIPS64 here as part
of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri.html">CHERI</a>
project).</p>

<p>We want to make sure that OCaml and its package ecosystem works just as well in
the embedded ecosystem as well as it does on vanilla x86 Linux.  This includes running on my
Linux iMac G5, my <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/arm/Raspberry%20Pi">FreeBSD Raspberry Pi</a>, my <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/beagle.html">OpenBSD Pandaboard</a>, or even on a
bytecode-only architecture like an <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/sparc64.html">OpenBSD/Sparc64</a>.</p>

<p>In the longer term, this paves the way to reliable cross-compiled packages for Windows, <a href="https://github.com/vouillon/ocaml-android">Android</a> and <a href="http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html">iPhone</a> (all of which have OCaml ports, but aren&#8217;t heavily tested with the full package database).  The only practical way to get started on this is by building an automated test infrastructure for OCaml that explores the feature matrix (which eerily for me, happened in the early days of Xen too, via <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2013/08/30/xenserver-automated-testing-and-lab-orchestration-introducing-xenrt/">XenRT</a> to stabilize the hypervisor).</p>

<h3>Why not Jenkins or Travis?</h3>

<p>When we first started hacking on the OPAM testing infrastructure earlier this
year, I maintained a local <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> installation that
monitored the repository.  While Jenkins is a superb tool for many continuous
integration tasks, it fell over badly when trying to use it on the non-x86 and
non-Linux (or Windows) operating systems.  Jenkins requires a full Java runtime
stack to be available on each of the client machines, which was taking up more
time to get up and running than a simple OCaml-based client and server that
could compile to both portable bytecode or fast native code.</p>

<p>The other difficulty with OPAM is selecting which packages actually need to be
tested, as it has a constraint-based package solver that supports expressive
forwards and backwards version restrictions.  While basic tests of the latest
packages worked with Jenkins, we needed to increasingly customize it to
automate interfacing directly with the OPAM libraries and calculating test
schedules based on incoming change requests.</p>

<p>Another factor that ruled out depending on hosted services such as
<a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> is that they tend to support x86-only
architectures, whereas we really want to test the full spectrum of CPU
variants supported by OCaml.  This doesn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s no place for
Travis of course, and in fact Mike Lin has already <a href="http://blog.mlin.net/2013/02/testing-ocaml-projects-on-travis-ci.html">made this work</a>
with OPAM.</p>

<p>For our full testing needs though,
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocamlot">OCamlot</a> was born: an OCaml client
and server system which coordinates different versions of the compiler,
architectures and OPAM versions and records the results for triage and
fixing issues.</p>

<h3>Running OCamlot</h3>

<p>The latest alpha release of OCamlot is pretty straightforward to run locally,
if you are so inclined.  First start a server process:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/ocamllabs/ocamlot
$ cd ocamlot
$ ./install_deps.sh
$ oasis setup
# (edit lib/config.ml if you need to change ports)
$ make
$ ./_build/lib/ocamlot_cmd.native --help
$ ./_build/lib/ocamlot_cmd.native serve
</code></pre>

<p>The server listens on localhost only by default, and normally an SSL-to-TCP
proxy is deployed to listen for external connections (I use
<a href="https://github.com/bumptech/stud">stud</a>, which is fast and easy to configure).</p>

<p>The OCamlot clients require a local compilation of OCaml, and they autodetect
their local CPU architecture and operating system.  I&#8217;ve put a <a href="https://gist.github.com/avsm/6393649">gist
script</a> together that automates this on
most Linux and BSD variants.  Just customize the top variables (set <code>MAKE</code> to
<code>gmake</code> under BSD) and set the hostname to your server process.</p>

<h3>The results repository and auto-triage</h3>

<p>Once the client is running, the server dispatches tasks from its test matrix,
which is calculated from the OPAM package repository.  The server maintains a
<a href="https://github.com/ocamlot/ocamlot-state">results repository</a>, which is a Git
filesystem database that records the build results and logs via an
s-expression per task.  It also uses <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp">Cohttp</a>
to serve up the results for a web browser.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very convenient using Git repositories like this since we can use GitHub
(or any other Git host) to coordinate and record results, and restart the
server without needing any local state.  So convenient, in fact, that Thomas
and I have been working on a more formal engine for this called
<a href="https://github.com/samoht/irminsule">Irminsule</a> (more on that in a later post,
though).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost unheard of to have a full OCamlot run go by without some errors,
and so David put together the <code>ocamlot triage</code> command.  This takes the
state repository and runs a set of regular expressions over it to classify them
into common errors.  The full file is
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocamlot/blob/master/lib/result.ml">here</a>, but an
excerpt should give you an idea of what we look for:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* ordered minor to severe *)</span>
	<span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">analysis</span> <span class="o">=</span>
	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Solver</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">solver_error</span> <span class="n">option</span>

	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Transient</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">transient_error</span>
	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">System</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">system_error</span>
	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">meta_error</span>
	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Ext_dep</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">ext_dep_error</span>
	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Build</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">build_error</span>
	  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Multiple</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">analysis</span> <span class="kt">list</span>
	    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">sexp</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The errors are ordered by severity to aid in color highlighting. They start with
OPAM solver failures and dependency failures (e.g. due to trying to build a
package that requires a specific OCaml version that isn&#8217;t available), and
move onto missing package dependencies or system libraris.</p>

<h2>Testing the run up to OCaml 4.01</h2>

<p>Of course, running all these tests is useless without taking action on the results. I&#8217;ve been
keeping track of them in <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/1029">issue #1029</a>.
The nice thing about GitHub issues is that when this bug is referenced in commits (even in
other repositories) a cross-reference shows up on that webpage and lets everything be tracked
nicely.</p>

<p>So what were the most common failures in the runup to 4.01, and what should you avoid when
writing your own code?</p>

<h3>Different standard library module signatures</h3>

<p>There have been a few changes to some of the functor signatures in the standard library, such as
adding a <code>find</code> function to Set (<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5864">mantis #5864</a>).
A third-party library that tries to match the functor signature will fail to compile with a type error, such
as this one below for <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/feeds/atom-ocaml.xml">zipperposition.0.2</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Error: The implementation src/ptset.ml
       does not match the interface src/ptset.cmi:
       ...
       In module Big:
       The field `find' is required but not provided
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant code in <code>zipperposition</code> makes it clear what the problem is:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="c">(* Big-endian Patricia trees *)</span>
	<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nc">Big</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">sig</span>
	  <span class="k">include</span> <span class="nn">Set</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">S</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">elt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">int</span>
	  <span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">intersect</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">bool</span>
	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This particular bug was <a href="https://github.com/c-cube/zipperposition/issues/1">reported
upstream</a>, and the fix
requires implementing the <code>find</code> function for the Patricia-tree-based <code>Set</code>.
Since the OPAM package will always be broken on OCaml 4.01, it was marked with
a <a href="https://github.com/ocamlpro/opam-repository/commit/e45530205987f67d4316a958446d3dcc954b19ec">compiler version constraint</a>
to prevent it being selected for installation under that compiler.  When a new
version with the fix is uploaded to OPAM, it will always be selected in
preference to this broken one.</p>

<p>One other 4.01 change that temporarily broke most of the bigger networking libraries such as
<a href="https://github.com/janestreet/core">Core</a>, <a href="https://ocsigen.org/lwt">Lwt</a> and <a href="http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org">Batteries</a>
was the addition of the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5568">close-on-exec</a> flag to the <code>Unix</code> module.
This change only affects upstream packages that redefine the UNIX module for their own purposes (such as adding an asynchronous I/O monad as Lwt does),
hence it affects the standard library replacement packages.</p>

<p>The fix here was to locally add patches into the relevant OPAM packages to
immediately unbreak things when the fix when into the 4.01 branch of the
compiler, and notify upstream maintainers to release new versions of their
projects.  There&#8217;s a subtle problem here: when a patch such as this goes into
an unreleased branch of the compiler (such as <code>4.01.0dev</code>), it&#8217;s hard to
reliably detect if the user has got the very latest version of the compiler or
not.
If you do have problems like this in the future, try recompiling via <code>opam switch reinstall &lt;version&gt;</code> to the latest branch.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very useful to be able to drop in bleeding-edge compiler tools into the
OPAM repository using compiler constraints like this.  For an example, see
Alain Frisch&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/ppx_tools.0.1/opam">ppx_tools</a>,
that require the very latest 4.02dev trunk release to compile his new
extension-points feature.</p>

<h3>Multiple object definitions</h3>

<p>OCaml 4.01 also restricts multiple method definitions with the same name in the
same object.  This leaves only inheritance as the way to override method names,
but some packages such as OCamlnet and Mlorg had minor uses of the old mechanism.</p>

<p>You can see this by using <code>opam switch</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ opam switch 4.00.1
$ eval `opam config env`
$ ocaml
# object method x = 1 method x = 2 end;;
- : &lt; x : int &gt; = &lt;obj&gt;
$ opam switch 4.01.0
$ eval `opam config env`
$ ocaml
# object method x = 1 method x = 2 end;;
Error: The method `x' has multiple definitions in this object
</code></pre>

<h3>New warnings, and the dreaded warnings-as-errors</h3>

<p>After a decade of being deprecated, the <code>(or)</code> and <code>(&amp;)</code> operators
finally had a warning turned on by default.</p>

<pre><code>$ ocaml
# true or false;;
Warning 3: deprecated feature: operator (or); you should use (||) instead
- : bool = true
</code></pre>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t normally be so bad, except that a surprising number of
released packages also turn warnings into fatal errors (by using the
<code>-w @</code> flags explained in the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/comp.html">manual</a>).
Warnings-as-errors is extremely useful when <em>developing</em> code but is
rather harmful in released code, since a future compiler can choose
to emit new warnings that aren&#8217;t necessarily fatal bugs.</p>

<p>Packages that failed like this include ocamlgraph, spotlib, quickcheck,
OPA, Lablgtk-extras and many more.  Please do make an effort to not
leave this option turned on in your packages, or else it makes life
more difficult for testing your code on bleeding edge versions of the
compiler in the future.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting here that OCaml 4.01 has introduced a fair number
of new and very useful warnings across a number of areas, mainly to do
with detecting unexpected ambiguation or shadowing of values.  I&#8217;ll
cover more on these in a future post about the new 4.01 goodies.</p>

<h3>External system dependencies</h3>

<p>While there any many packages in OPAM that are pure OCaml, there are
also a substantial number that require other system tools to be installed.
The Lablgtk GUI library obviously requires the C <code>gtk</code> library to be
installed.</p>

<p>Determining if these libraries are installed on a particular OS is
well beyond the scope of OPAM, as there are almost as many package
managers as there are operating systems.  However, it&#8217;s important for
automated testing and user-friendly error messages to have some notion
of detecting if the environment is ready for the OCaml package or not.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re solving this by using a <code>depexts</code> field in OPAM that consists
of a set of tags that identify OS-specific packages that need to be
present.  A separate script can query these tags from OPAM and do the
OS-specific tests or installation.</p>

<p>For example, here&#8217;s the <code>sqlite3-ocaml</code> OPAM description:</p>

<pre><code>opam-version: "1"
maintainer: "markus.mottl@gmail.com"
build: [
  ["ocaml" "setup.ml" "-configure"]
  ["ocaml" "setup.ml" "-build"]
  ["ocaml" "setup.ml" "-install"]
]
remove: [ ["ocamlfind" "remove" "sqlite3"] ]
depends: ["ocamlfind"]
depexts: [
  [ ["debian"  ] [ "libsqlite3-dev"]    ]
  [ ["freebsd" ] [ "database/sqlite3"]  ]
  [ ["openbsd" ] [ "database/sqlite3"]  ]
]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>depexts</code> field here lists APT package for Debian, and the ports
tree locations for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.  It could also list more specialised
tags for particular versions of an OS.  You can query this from OPAM
as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ opam install -e debian sqlite3-ocaml
libsqlite3-dev
$ opam install -e openbsd sqlite3-ocaml
database/sqlite3
</code></pre>

<p>OCamlot therefore needs to query the <code>depexts</code> field from the package and
run the right <code>apt</code> or <code>pkg_add</code> commands.  I&#8217;ll write about this in more
detail when it&#8217;s fully baked, as we&#8217;ve modified the semantics of the tag
querying between OPAM 1.0 and OPAM 1.1 to make it easier to use in OCamlot.</p>

<h3>Portable shell scripts</h3>

<p>Once we&#8217;ve gotten past the hurdle of the compiler version causing failures, there is the
small matter of testing non-Linux operating systems, as well as non-x86
CPU architectures.  The <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/1029">#1029 overview</a>
lists many of these failures under the Portability section.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openbsd.org"><img src="http://anil.recoil.org/images/ppuf200X181.gif" style="float:right" /></a></p>

<p>Damien Doligez made some excellent points about how to write <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/portable-conditionals-in-makefiles/">portable
Makefiles</a>
that works across both GNU and BSD makes.  This is why the carefully crafted
OCaml Makefiles do not require GNU make to be installed when compiling on
FreeBSD or OpenBSD (MacOS X gave up the fight a long time ago and installs GNU
make as its default <code>make</code> command).</p>

<p>OPAM tries to help out BSD by providing a <code>make</code> macro in <code>opam</code> files that
is substituted with either <code>"make"</code> (by default) or <code>"gmake"</code> (for BSD).
While this works for for the toplevel invocation of the Makefile, it fails
if the Makefile recursively invokes further targets without using the <code>$(MAKE)</code>
variable instead of directly calling the command.
Patching these sorts of things is easy but tedious: see the <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/facile.1.1/files/bsdmake.patch">patchfile</a> for the
Facile constraint programming library for an example.</p>

<p>The real problem here, of course, is that package maintainers cannot be reasonably
expected to test their code on systems that they don&#8217;t normally use&#8211;if we demanded
perfect portability to be present in the main OPAM repository, we would&#8217;t get
any submissions!</p>

<p>OCamlot automates this nicely though, by finding lots of portability bugs
automatically, and maintainers are by-and-large very responsive when we report
the problem upstream.</p>

<h2>The emerging distributed workflow</h2>

<p>The big drawback to OCamlot in its current form is the amount of triage effort
it puts on the OPAM maintainers.  The package database has now exceeded 500
packages in just a short few months, and has over 1500 unique versions that
all need build testing and more accurate constraints.  The wider community has
been <em>really</em> keen to participate in helping with triage (just look at all the
other people that leapt in on <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/1029">bug #1029</a>),
so its our immediate priority to make OCamlot more transparent for people that
want to use it to improve their own packages, and in the future also use it
to test various hypotheses about all the available open-source OCaml code
(see Jacques&#8217; experiment with <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/monomorphic_let/">monomorphic let</a> as
an example of something that can benefit from wider automated compilation).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll talk more about how we&#8217;re solving this in my upcoming <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/">OCaml 2013
Workshop</a> talk about the Platform.  I
don&#8217;t want spoil it too much, but it involves a lovely distributed Git
workflow, an enhanced <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam2web">opam2web</a>, and a
brand new metadata overlay system for OPAM that lets us enhance the package
database with extra information such as statistics, portability and test
results, but without polluting the main Git repository with all this extra
non-essential data.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re really curious to know right now, then you can see the outline of the
new system at Amir&#8217;s <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">new ocaml.org
wireframes</a> blog post,
where Part III contains the continuous integration workflow.  A lot of infrastructure
work has gone into building all of this over the summer, and now it&#8217;s all
starting to be deployed in a very satisfying way&#8230;</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>The <code>0install</code> command has many subcommands (<code>0install run</code>, <code>0install download</code>, etc), which accept different, but overlapping, sets of options. Running a command happens in two phases: first we parse the options, then we pass them to a handler function. We split the parsing and handling because the tab-completion and help system also need to know which options go with which command.</p>

<p>Using plain (non-polymorphic) variants I originally implemented it a bit like this (simplified). I had a single type which listed all the possible options:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">zi_option</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Refresh</span>		<span class="c">(* --refresh *)</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Show</span>		<span class="c">(* --show *)</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Wrapper</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="kt">string</span>	<span class="c">(* --wrapper=echo *)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Each command handler takes a list of options and processes them:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="c">(* use refresh/show... *)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Each handler function has the same type: <code>zi_option list -&gt; unit</code> (they take a list of options and return nothing).</p>

<p>Finally, there is a table of sub-commands, giving the parser and handler for each one:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">subcommands</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"run"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">parse_run</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">handle_run</span><span class="o">));</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"download"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">parse_download</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">handle_download</span><span class="o">));</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>But those <code>assert false</code> lines are worrying. An <code>assert false</code> means the programmer believes the code can&#8217;t be executed, but didn&#8217;t manage to convince the compiler. If we declare that a subcommand accepts a flag, but forget to implement it, the program will crash at runtime (this isn&#8217;t as unlikely as it sounds, because we declare options in groups, so adding an option to a group affects several subcommands).</p>

<h2>Polymorphic variants</h2>

<p>Polymorphic variants are written with a back-tick/grave before them, and you don&#8217;t need to declare them before use. For example, we can declare
<code>handle_run</code> like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">handle_run</span> <span class="n">options</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">refresh</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ref</span> <span class="bp">false</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">wrapper</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ref</span> <span class="nc">None</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="nn">ListLabels</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span> <span class="n">options</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">:(</span><span class="k">function</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">Refresh</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">refresh</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">true</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="nc">Wrapper</span> <span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">wrapper</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="n">w</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="c">(* use refresh/wrapper... *)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>OCaml will automatically infer the type of this function as:</p>

<pre><code>[&lt; `Refresh | `Wrapper of string ] list -&gt; unit
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>handle_run</code> takes of list of options, where the options are a subset of <code>Refresh</code> and <code>Wrapper</code>. Notice that the <code>assert</code> is gone.</p>

<p>Now you can call <code>handle_run (parse_run argv)</code>, and it&#8217;s a compile-time error if <code>handle_run</code> doesn&#8217;t handle every option that <code>parse_run</code> may produce.</p>

<p>There is, however, a problem when we try to put these functions in the <code>subcommands</code> list. OCaml wants every list item to have the same type, and so wants every subcommand to handle every option. The compile then fails because they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>My first thought to fix this was to declare an existential type. e.g.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">option_parser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="kt">list</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="kt">list</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="kt">list</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">unit</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">subcommand</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">exists</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">option_parser</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">handler</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to say that each subcommand has a parser and a handler and, while we don&#8217;t know what subset of the options they process, the subsets are the same.
Sadly, OCaml doesn&#8217;t have existential types.</p>

<p>However, we can get the same effect by declaring a class or closure:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="line"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">subcommand</span> <span class="n">option_parser</span> <span class="n">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">end</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This works because the <code>subcommand</code> function has a for-all type (for all types <code>a</code>, it accepts an <code>a parser</code> and an <code>a handler</code> and produces an object that doesn&#8217;t expose the type <code>a</code> in its interface: <code>parse_and_run</code> just has the type <code>string list -&gt; unit</code>.</p>

<p>However, if we want to expose the parser on its own (e.g. for the tab-completion) we have to cast it first. Here, the <code>parse</code> method simply returns a <code>zi_option list</code>, losing the information about exactly which subset of the options it might return (which is fine for the completion code). This allows all subcommand objects to expose the same interface:</p>

<p>So, I think this is rather nice:</p>

<ul>  <li>Every option displayed in the help for a command is accepted by that command.</li>
  <li>We don&#8217;t need any asserts in the handlers (indeed, adding the assert destroys the safety, since the handler will then accept any option).</li>
</ul>

<p>One final trick: when matching variants you can use the <code>#type</code> syntax to match a set of options. e.g. the real <code>handle_run</code> looks more like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>That is, it processes the run-specific options itself, while delegating common options (<code>--offline</code>, etc) and storing selection options (<code>--version</code>, etc) in a separate list to be passed to the selection code. The <code>select_opts</code> list gets the correct sub-type (<code>select_option list</code>).</p>

reading early content is hard work, and hugely appreciate the spirited
feedback!  The book is now a week away from being handed over to the

  <li>    <p>The chapters on first-class modules, parsing with Menhir, and objects
and classes have been significantly revised from beta1. Our thanks to
Leo White for contributing significantly to the latter two chapters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>All the code snippets and terminal outputs are now mechanically generated.

available online. We really like the collaborative spirit of the commenting
system, and will likely extend this to collecting exercises from our readers
on an ongoing basis.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s been quite a bit of feedback and conversation about the book, so this
also seemed like a good point to checkpoint the process somewhat.</p>

<h2>Crowd sourcing community feedback</h2>

<p><a href="http://realworldocaml.org"><img align="right" src="http://anil.recoil.org/images/oreilly-cover.gif" style="padding-left:15px" /></a>
<em>Good</em>: The decision to crowdsource feedback has been exhausting but very
worthwhile, with over 2,200 <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">comments</a> posted (and over 2,000
resolved by us too!).  O&#8217;Reilly has a similar platform called
<a href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com">Atlas</a> that wasn&#8217;t quite ready when we started
our book, but I&#8217;d highly encourage new authors to go down this route and not
stick with a traditional editorial scheme.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simply not possible for a
small group of technical reviewers to notice as many errors as the wider
community has. Having said this, it&#8217;s interesting how much more focussed and
critical the comments of our editor <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/andyo">Andy Oram</a>
were when compared to most of the wider community feedback, so the commenting system is
definitely a complement and not a replacement to the editorial process.</p>

<h3>The GitHub requirement</h3>

<p><em>Bad</em>: After the first beta, we got criticized on a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5893168">Hacker News</a> thread
for passing around Github oAuth tokens without SSL.
This was entirely my fault, and I corrected the site to be pure-SSL within 24 hours.</p>

<p><em>Ugly</em>: In my defence though, I <em>dont want</em> the authority that all the
reviewers have granted to me for their Github accounts!  We need just two
things to enable commenting: an identity service to cut down on spam comments,
and the ability to create issues in a <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">public repository</a>.  Unfortunately, Github&#8217;s
<a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes">scope</a> API requires you to also
grant us access to commit to public code repositories.  Add on the fact that
around 6,000 people have clicked through the oAuth API to review RWO, and you
start to see just how much code we potentially have access to.
I did try to reduce the damage by not actually storing the oAuth tokens on the
server-side.  Instead, we store it in the client using a secure cookie, so you
can easily reset your browser to log out.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just about authentication either: another reader
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ocaml/comments/1gil84/public_beta_of_real_world_ocaml/cal811r">points out</a>
that if they use GitHub during work hours, they have no real way of separating
the news streams that result.</p>

<p>Much of the frustration here is that there&#8217;s nothing I can do to fix this except
wait for GitHub to hopefully improve their service.  I very much hope that GitHub
is listening to this and has internal plans to overhaul their privilege management
APIs.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure-free hosting</h3>

<p><em>Good</em> and <em>Bad</em>: One of my goals with the commenting infrastructure was to try
and eliminate all server-side code, so that we could simply publish the book
onto Github Pages and use JavaScript for the comment creation and listing.</p>

<p>This <em>almost</em> worked out. We still need a tiny HTTP proxy for comment creation,
as we add contextual information such as a milestone to every new comment to
make it easier to index.  Setting a milestone requires privileged access to the
repository and so our server-side proxy creates the issue using the
user-supplied oAuth token (so that it originates from the commenter), and then
updates it (via the <a href="http://github.com/bactrian">bactrian</a> account) to add the
milestone add insert a little contextual comment pointing back to the book
paragraph where the comment originated from.</p>

<p><em>Good</em>: The other criticism from the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gipea/first_public_beta_of_real_world_ocaml_book/cakmeuz">online
feedback</a>
was the <em>requirement</em> to have a Github login to read the book at all.  This is a
restriction that we intend to lift for the final release (which will be freely
available online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">CC-BY-NC-ND</a> license),
but I think it&#8217;s absolutely the right decision to gateway early adopters to get
useful feedback.  Even if we lost 90% of our potential reviewers through the
Github auth wall, I don&#8217;t think we could have coped with another 10,000
comments in any case.</p>

<p>On the positive side, we didn&#8217;t have a single spam comment or other abuses of
the commenting system at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had quite a few queries been open-sourcing the
<a href="http://github.com/realworldocaml/scripts">scripts</a> that drive the server-side
commenting, and this on my TODO list for after the final book has gone to
production.</p>

<h2>Auto-generating the examples</h2>

<p><em>Bad</em>: We tried for far too long during the book writing to stumble through
with manual installation instructions and hand-copied code snippets and 
outputs.  Some of our alpha reviewers pointed out <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments/issues/236">vociferously</a>
that spending time on installation and dealing with code typos was not a good
use of their time.</p>

<p><em>Good</em>: <a href="http://bolinfest.com">Michael Bolin</a> was entirely correct in his
criticism (and incidentally, one of our most superstar reviewers).  The latest
beta has an entirely mechanically generated toolchain that lets us regenerate
the entire book output from a cold start by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples">examples</a>
repository.  In retrospect, I should have written this infrastructure a year ago,
and I&#8217;d recommend any new books of this sort focus hard on automation from
the early days.</p>

<p>Luckily, my automation <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/scripts">scripts</a>
could crib heavily from existing open-source OCaml projects that had portions
of what we needed, such as <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop">uTop</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> (and my thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/diml">Jeremie Dimino</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Chris00">Christophe Troestler</a> for
their help here).</p>

<p><em>Awesome</em>: We&#8217;re hacking on a little surprise for the final online version of the
book, based on this build infrastructure.  Stay <a href="http://try.ocamlpro.com">tuned</a>!</p>
